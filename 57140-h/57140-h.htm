<p>While the factions at Court thus held one another
at bay, Lord Holland was endeavouring to persuade
Lord Bute to take again an office of business.
But the rash fit, like the small-pox, never
seized him but once. He chose to insinuate opinion
of his power, rather than to display it. Nor,
though the Favourite professed that Lord Holland
was the only man who never deceived him, could
I on the nicest inspection ever discover that Lord
Holland had any real weight with him; whether it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
was owing to Lord Bute’s want of courage, or want
of confidence in the adviser.</p>

<p>Though I saw clouds enough to comfort me with
the prospect of a storm, yet, there being no open
hostilities commenced, it was difficult for me to unravel
the windings and turnings of so many minds,
who were all my enemies. Though I was disposed
to widen any breach that might happen, by inclining
our force to one side or the other, yet it was
not prudent to slacken our measures against the
united body. Temporizing too far might cool the
zeal of our friends; and the distance of six or seven
months to the meeting of Parliament might wear
out the memory of Mr. Conway’s wrongs, as the
Ministry had intended it should, they having forborne
to dismiss him till the session was over. The
public cause, as well as private injury, called for
spirit. The higher we could raise the flame of Opposition,
the sounder benefit we conferred on our
country. Prerogative was the object of the Court;
and corruption so flagrant in both Houses of Parliament,
that, if the people were not animated enough
to hold both in check, no resource would be left
but a civil war. Early opposition was the only
preservative against the latter. My nature shuddered
at the thoughts of blood, and I felt what
every good man will feel in civil commotions, <em>that
there is nothing so difficult as to make the people go far
enough, and prevent their going too far</em>. An opportunity
presented itself that shewed me what I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
have done, but, thank God! I was not so culpable
as to embrace it. As one of my objects was to
raise the characters and popularity of our party, I
had inserted a paragraph in the newspapers observing
that the abolition of vails to servants had been
set on foot by the Duke of Bedford, and had been
opposed and not complied with by the Duke of
Devonshire and family of Cavendish. Soon after, a
riot happened at Ranelagh, in which the footmen
mobbed and ill-treated some gentlemen who had
been active in that reformation. I was apprehensive
lest any personal mischief should happen to
the Duke of Bedford, and forbore to spirit up that
contest, though I desired so much to make the Ministers
both odious and ridiculous. To the first,
indeed, their characters were open: but the worse
they were, the more difficult it was to make them
ridiculous. They were so profligate, that they were
the first to laugh and the last to feel. It was more
my business, too, to incense the people than to
divert them. Our party was more popular than
fashionable; and in a very corrupt age fashion is
very formidable. Nor was this all the difficulty: I
wished to secure liberty, and to revenge my friend
without passing the bounds allowed against public
enemies. My friends were timid, or cautious, or
over-candid; and I experienced what I have said
before, that a country will never be saved by the
best men in it. Ours had been rescued by two of
the worst—Lord Temple and Wilkes. I had little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
but my pen to carry on the cause with; and I knew
any violence would not be more disrelished by my
enemies than by friends. Half our party was likely
to desert us; and the other half not likely to support
me. When a man is borne up by party, abuse
little affects him; but I did not choose to encounter
it when I might be left to stand the fire
alone. I had seen the fate of Wilkes, abandoned
by all he had served; and had no mind to accompany
him in his exile. Still, my honour and
my pride would not suffer me to sit patient under
the insults offered both to Mr. Conway and myself.
I determined to vindicate his character and assert
my own independence in a manner that should do
credit to both; and I succeeded, happily, by observing
at once so much firmness and decency, that
while I held him up as a perfect character, I secured
my own as a faithful and undaunted friend.
The opportunity was offered to me by a most shameless
and illiberal attack made on him officiously by
the agents of the Ministry in a thing called “An
Address to the Public on a late Dismission.” This I
answered in a Counter-Address.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> It was replied to
by the first author, one Guthrie, in a style at once
so gross and tedious, that if any man could have
patience to read it, I should desire he would form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
his idea of that Ministry from that production. The
only sentence worth refuting was my being charged
with having flattered and been obliged to George
Grenville. I, who had never stooped to comply
with Lord Holland while connected with him; who
had set at defiance the power of the Pelhams; had
not bowed to the plenitude of Lord Bute’s power,
nor courted even Mr. Pitt when I admired him
most in the zenith of credit and victory; was not
likely to have bent the knee to the prater Grenville,
with whom I had broken almost as soon as he had
any power at all. Let that imputation answer itself!—But
I was obliged to him, said the pamphlet—hear
in what manner. Almost every friend or
dependent I ever had could witness my refusals of
soliciting Ministers for them or for myself. But
when Grenville was Treasurer of the Navy, I had,
at the desire of one of my voters at Lynn, desired
him to get a child into the academy at Greenwich,
which he granted. Another time, for I will be
rigorously sincere in stating my obligations to him,
I had heard that American officers were to repair
thither, or forfeit their places. My deputy, who
enjoyed a sinecure in Philadelphia (I think it was),
came to me in a fright, and begged I would intercede
for his being excused, as he was in a deplorable
state of health, which terminated in less than two
years in his being bed-ridden, or seldom able to stir
out of bed. Still, I would not ask his being excused,
but wrote to Mr. Grenville to beg that if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
no fault was alleged against my deputy, and the
order was not general, he might not be laid under
the cruel necessity of throwing up his employment.
Mr. Grenville civilly answered, that he knew of no
such order or intention; that he would inquire into
it, and no particular hardship should be laid on
the person I interceded for. I have preserved his
letter; and have thus stated my obligations. Whether
they were so mighty that they ought to have
balanced in my mind Mr. Conway’s ruin, the world
will judge; or, if I forgot them, I must own I had
not so accurate a memory as that minute Minister.
The pamphlet, however, being enriched with this
anecdote of my obligations, must have been directed
by Grenville himself—and it was tedious enough to
have been written by him too.</p>

<p>This was not the only instance of Grenville’s borrowing
scraps of reputation by the hands of his dependents.
I have some tracts corrected by himself.
The writers, as they were communicated to me <em>in
confidence by the authors, I will not name</em>. There
was another scribe who laboured hard in extolling
his patron. This was Dr. Lloyd, tutor to Mr. Grenville’s
sons, and promoted by him to the Deanery
of Norwich.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> This Zany published a most fulsome
panegyric on him, addressed to himself, crying him
up as the first financier in Europe, and obliquely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
insinuating his enmity to Lord Bute. When Grenville
was attacked in the preceding winter in a
celebrated tract called the Budget,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> written by Mr.
Hartley,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> and exposing the blunders, and fallacies,
and triflingness of his system, Grenville inveighed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
bitterly in the House of Commons against such
liberties, and protested he had never been concerned
in any libels. I sat and heard these solemn
falsehoods; having, I protest, seen Mrs. Grenville
take out of her bureau and deliver to the author in
my presence a rancorous pamphlet, written against
Lord Temple and Mr. Pitt, corrected by Mr. Grenville’s
own hand,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> and published immediately afterwards.
This confidence I would not abuse.</p>

<p>There came out, not long after my pamphlet, another
piece that <em>was to have</em> made much noise. It
was called “A Defence of the Minority in the House
of Commons on the Question relating to General
Warrants;” and had no meaner an author than
Charles Townshend. His prodigious parts must
not be judged of by this, or indeed by any of his
few writings. He never was an author in proportion
to his abilities. His thoughts flowed in
too rapidly to give him time to digest them; nor
was he ever enough in earnest about anything to
consider it deliberately. This piece had poor success;
and was confuted by some able retainer, if
not by some able member of the Administration.
Townshend was hurt by this miscarriage; and as
he was, though so superior to rivals, infinitely jealous,
he could not avoid conceiving a little spleen
against me, though posterity may take my word,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
ay, and my vanity’s word, that I never felt myself
so little as the moment he opened his mouth. I do
not know whether they would own it with equal
frankness, but many men greatly excelling me in
talents, ought to have shrunk, too, into themselves,
and felt their own futility when Charles Townshend
was present. Yet such alloy did he bear
about him to those marvellous parts, that children
and women had more discretion and fewer weaknesses.
Being hurt at the success of my Counter-Address,
he wrote these very words to Mr. Conway:
“The touches and re-touches on your character are
fine; some strokes nobly free; but in general not
what I expected. So Charles Yorke and others
of our friends think.” Then, speaking of his own
pamphlet, he added, “Mr. Pitt says it has had prodigious
effect, and turned many. Grenville says
it is serious, of great weight, and very hostile.”
At that very instant Mr. Conway and I happened to
know that Mr. Pitt declared he would not read it;
and having afterwards read it, said he found it
very inaccurate. There was the same want of truth
in affirming that Grenville called it <em>very hostile</em>.
Townshend was afraid his friends should perceive
how far it was from being offensive.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>It must not be supposed that I would pass off
these trifling anecdotes of myself and others for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
history of England. But they contain that most
useful part of all history, a picture of human minds.
They shew how little men are, though riding at
what is called <em>the Top of the World</em>. These and the
following scenes were what filled me with disgust,
and made me quit that splendid theatre of pitiful
passions; not from having been too good for my
company, but ashamed of being one of such <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dramatis
Personæ</i>: and so far more inexcusable than
the rest, that neither ambition nor interest had led
me behind the curtain—perhaps if they had, I should
have remained there still.</p>

<p>I have mentioned my surprise at the coldness
of Lord Temple. What was become of that unwearied
alacrity with which he used to unbosom
all his factious soul on every man that was ill-used
or discontented? Whatever his views were, they
were not ripe: and therefore, to retain a party, or
the appearance of it, he gave a great dinner to the
Opposition. I was of it; and after dinner took
occasion to explain the threats and arbitrary language
tried upon Mr. Conway, and scorned by him.
I forbore to name Grenville, but painted him plainly
enough to fill the company with surprise and indignation.
As the company was promiscuous, the discourse
was circulated about the town, and reached
Mr. Grenville’s ears. On the 1st of June I received
a letter from Mr. Thomas Pitt, desiring me to contradict
a report said to come from me, charging Mr.
Grenville with having said that if Mr. Conway voted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
according to his conscience he must be turned out.
Thus had they dressed up the real report and substance
in absurd terms that nobody might believe it.
I immediately comprehended that this was a mandate
issued to me as an inferior officer of the Exchequer,
to justify Grenville and sacrifice my friend.
I perceived, too, the advantage they had put into
my hands, and determined to make the most of it.
Pitt’s letter was so incredibly weak, and owned so
much, that nothing was easier than to confute it.
To add to their confusion, I had preserved exact
minutes of the two conversations with Pitt and
Grenville, of which they had had no suspicion. I
felt the opportunity of doing justice both to Mr.
Conway and to myself; and of making Mr. Grenville
understand, that if he did not do me justice
in the regularity of my payments, he was at my
mercy, and must expect those letters would be laid
before the public, if not before the House of Commons.
This I hinted obscurely, being determined
that nothing but persecution should drive me to
that step. Knowing, however, the narrowness of
Grenville’s mind, it was useful to curb him by this
menace, as I did too in the Counter-Address, and
very successfully. I wrote a long, firm, and unpleasant
letter in answer to Pitt’s, and received another
from him before there could be time for it (as he
was in Cornwall), but by Grenville’s opening mine
at the post: for with him was it concerted; and yet
so flimsy, so fallen from the arrogance of the former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
was their reply, that I enjoyed not only triumph,
but, I own, the teazing amusement of keeping
them in hot water many months—the only
use I allowed myself to make of those letters in
punishing their culpable behaviour—moderate revenge
enough after such insolence! and in which,
when I had suffered the period to elapse, Grenville
was far from having the generosity to imitate me.
My payments were carefully made before the Parliament
opened. When I had let the Session pass
over without making use of the materials in my
hands, an embargo was laid on the income of my
employment. Have I been unjust in saying that
almost any steps that are lawfully taken against
banditti, were justifiable against such men? But
I found means to retaliate, without violating the
strictest laws of honour: nor have they been able
to reproach me, though I had such opportunities
of resembling them. Happily, I shall not have
occasion to say more of myself for many pages, for
though <em>I</em> slept not, the Opposition did.</p>

<p>Mechell, the King of Prussia’s minister, was
recalled. That Prince had formerly desired Sir
Charles Hanbury Williams might be recalled by us,
without assigning reasons for that request. He was
now reminded of that transaction, and called upon
to satisfy us in the same manner. An epigram in
politics very consonant to the genius of Sandwich,
who loved to strike a stroke, and never allowed
for the bad consequences it might have.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
About the same time our merchants printed a
memorial in the newspapers, complaining of their
not being permitted to cut logwood; an ill appearance
after a peace so favourable to them, and so
recent. The Ministers published in the Gazette the
King of Spain’s denial of knowing anything of that
refusal, yet was not the Spanish Governor punished
or recalled: and ere this matter was cold, Monsieur
de Guerchy presented a memorial, demanding
restitution of effects appertaining to the Duchy
of Bretagne, that had been plundered from Belleisle.
The Ministers referred the matter to General Hodgson,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
who replied, “he had been ordered to take
Belleisle, and had taken it: he knew nothing farther.”</p>

<p>On July 8th died William Pulteney, Earl of
Bath,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> little considered, though immensely rich; for
it was known that he would neither part with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
money to do good or harm. He left his vast wealth
to an old brother whom he despised, and a few legacies
to ancient domestics; but so sparingly, that
it was plain he thought the smallest sum a valuable
present.</p>

<p>On the 10th came on the trial of the Chevalier
d’Eon. He had asked for farther time to assemble
witnesses, but being refused, made no defence;
and absconding, was found guilty. He remained in
England, and often in London, undisturbed and unnoticed.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
The printers of the “North Briton” were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
likewise found guilty. Lord Mansfield reprimanded
Sergeant Glynn, counsel for the prisoners, for telling
the jury that they were judges both of law
and fact; the former of which, the Chief Justice
denied, and said, if it was controverted he would
take the opinion of the Judges thereon—a resource
he was fond of applying to, when he could not
alone support his own arbitrary assertions. He and
the Ministers now finding themselves almost irresistible,
pursued their blow. Two hundred informations
were filed against printers: a larger number
than had been prosecuted in the whole thirty-three
years of the last reign!</p>

<p>On the 15th of the following month, came advice
of Tortuga, or Turks’ Island, being seized by
Count d’Estain. This man had been twice taken
prisoner by us in the last war, and both times had
forfeited his parole of honour; yet with a laudable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
clemency had been spared.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> France had rewarded
him with the Order of the Holy Ghost; and he
now commanded a squadron in the West Indies,
with which he committed this new hostility and infraction
of the peace. I saw the importance of the
moment, and endeavoured to spirit up addresses
against the peace-makers; but languor prevailed,
and none of our great Lords could be brought to
send directions to their agents for transfusing indignation
through their counties. In the meantime
the Ministers made representations at Versailles,
which, however, despairing of redress, they
did not dare to announce in the Gazette till an
answer came disavowing D’Estain, and promising to
restore the island and pay damages; yet with no
mark of displeasure towards their own commander,
who, it was not doubted, had acted by direction,
both to keep down our stocks, and in revenge for
some vessels, which one of our captains had burned
at Newfoundland, where they had encroached. The
man justified himself by his general orders; nor did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
the Ministers, though they privately reprimanded
him for his zeal, dare to break him; but fearing
farther hostilities, four men-of-war were ordered to
Newfoundland.</p>

<p>Mr. Legge, after languishing some months, died
August 23rd. A blow considerable to our party,
as he was the only man in it proper, on a
change, to have been placed at the head of the
House of Commons. His abilities were known and
respected; his timidity and time-serving had not
been much remarked, but by the few he had been
most conversant with; for, being supple and cheerful
and never offensive, he had always seemed to
loiter behind his party, rather than to desert it.
He met death with more manliness and unconcern
than could have been expected, as he was not
old, was happy, rich, and above the affectation of
heroism or philosophy. An old friend visiting him
the day before he died, Legge said to him, “Brother
sportsman, I used to laugh at your being too
heavy for a chase, but now you are come in at the
death.” It was not equally sensible and unaffected,
that he sent to Mr. Pitt, to acquaint him with his
own approaching dissolution, and to exhort him to
do his utmost to remove the present Ministers.
Legge ought to have known how little Pitt would
regard the death-bed admonition of a man for
whom living he had little veneration. Legge left
behind him, with orders for publication, a relation
of his quarrel with Lord Bute, relating to an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
election for Hampshire. This piece neither hurt
the Favourite, nor reflected honour on the deceased.
That the former should have meddled in an election,
even before his master’s accession to the
Crown, could not surprise nor seriously shock any
man: nor, though the narrative was not to appear
till after his death, had Legge worked it up with
a spirit to do himself honour. His obsequiousness
pierced through the veil of hostility, and everybody
saw that, without other views, he would not
have encountered a rising Minister; nor by Legge’s
own account, had the Favourite mitigated the scorn
with which he treated him. I have said that Lord
Bath loved money so much, that he thought a paltry
sum, though given after his death, considerable
bounty: it was much the same with Legge, he
was so naturally compliant and inoffensive, that
his daring to order the publication of a tame and
posthumous satire seemed to him an effort of prodigious
vengeance.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
If the Ministers exerted little spirit against our
neighbours, it was feared, on the other hand, that
there were hostile views in the disposal of military
commands at home. In fact, the Scotch obtained
commissions every day: if by Lord Bute’s influence,
I rather think it was meant for a defensive guard
for himself and the Court, than with views offensive
to the Constitution. Depending on favour and promotion,
the Scotch themselves might have crowded
into the army. Still it spread jealousy and alarm;
and Mr. Pitt himself expressed dissatisfaction.
These murmurs were largely increased by the elevation
of one Colonel Fletcher to an old regiment
over thirty-seven officers his seniors, among whom
was Colonel Howe,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> brother of the Lord of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
name, and himself lately returned with glory from
the Havannah. As Fletcher was devoted to the
Favourite, and known to owe this promotion to him,
the partiality was the more grievously resented.
To compensate for this step, the next regiment that
fell was bestowed on Sir William Boothby,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> but
not without the secondary view of gaining this
officer, who was a servant of the Duke of York.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
That Prince returning from Italy passed to Paris;
on which the King stopped his remittances, and
obliged him to come home without delay. Grenville,
who had taken umbrage at Lord Bute’s interfering
in the disposal of military preferments, procured
Sir William Boothby’s former regiment for
Colonel Pearson.</p>

<p>To give the finishing blow to the hopes and credit
of the Opposition, the Duke of Devonshire,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> who
had gone to Spa at the end of August for a paralytic
disorder, died there in the vigour of his age. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
was by no means an able or enterprising man, but
enjoyed a character uncommonly respected; and was
universally regretted by all the Whigs as head of
their party. No man would have disputed that pre-eminence
with him; and we wanted even a nominal
head. We had in the space of a few months lost
three material men,—Lord Hardwicke, Mr. Legge
and the Duke of Devonshire. It was almost as
unfortunate that we had kept Charles Yorke, Charles
Townshend, and the Duke of Newcastle. The
health of the Duke of Cumberland made his life as
little to be depended on. At this very time he had
two slight fits at Newmarket, and was reported
dead; but was saved by the breaking out of St.
Antony’s fire. The Duke of Devonshire bequeathed
5000<i>l.</i> to Mr. Conway; a legacy honourable to him,
and conducive to his popularity. The nominal post
of High Treasurer of Ireland being vacated by the
death of that Duke, Lord Sandwich begged it for
Lord Corke,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> (who had married his niece, and from
whose family it had passed to the Cavendishes by
the marriage of the late Duke with the heiress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
of Boyle,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>) but on supposition only that the new
Duke would not ask it. “How shall we know,”
said the King, “if his uncles will ask it for him?”
Lord Sandwich said he could find out by his old
fellow-traveller Lord Besborough,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> who had married
the late Duke’s sister. Lord Besborough, on the
question being put to him by Sandwich as from
himself, said laughing, “My Lord, is this to be a
retainer?” “Why, to be sure,” replied Sandwich;
“it will be expected that the family should not act
as they have done.” The young Duke was but sixteen,
was awkward, and full of the bashfulness of
his race. He was entirely in the hands of his
three uncles, the Lords George, Frederick, and
John, all warm Whigs, enthusiasts to the memory
of their father and brother, of characters eminently
unstained, and not a little persuaded that their
family was, and ought to be, the most distinguished
in the kingdom. Their property was enormous,
their credit great, and reputation truly honourable:
but the talents of the race had never borne any
proportion to their other advantages. The first
Duke, besides being the finest gentleman of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
age, had succeeded to the merits of his friend Lord
Russel’s martyrdom. Since that period the family
had affected to drop all polish, and to wear the
manners of plain English gentlemen, under an outside
that covered considerable pride. Sir Robert
Walpole had made advantage of their popularity,
and having strongly attached the second and third
Dukes to himself, he had placed them before himself
as the leaders of the Whig party, and cried up
their unembellished good sense, though the second
Duke had no sense at all,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> and the third a very
dubious portion.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> William, the fourth and late
Duke, with something more of the manners of a
Court, had less abilities than his father. His brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
Lord George<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> had none at all. Lord Frederick
was lively, and having lived in Courts and
Camps, a favourite of the Duke of Cumberland, was
by far the most agreeable, and possessed the most
useful sense of the whole family.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> Lord John, the
youngest, was hitherto little known. I shall have
occasion to mention him frequently hereafter. He
had read a good deal, and his eyes saw not faster
than his memory retained. He was accurate in
repeating words, sentences, nay volumes, if he
pleased; nor was he defective in quickness or reasoning.
Under the appearance of virgin modesty,
he had a confidence in himself that nothing could
equal, and a thirst of dominion that was still more
extraordinary. It consisted solely in governing
those with whom he was connected, without views
either of interest or power. To be first, in however
small a circle, was his wish; but in that circle he
must be absolute: and he was as ready to sacrifice
the interests and fortunes of those his friends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
and slaves, as he was his own. His plan seemed
to be the tyranny of a moral philosopher. He was
a kind of Heresiarch, that sought to be adored
by his enthusiastic disciples, without a view of
extending his sect beyond that circle.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> His fair
little person, and the quaintness with which he
untreasured, as by rote, the stores of his memory,
occasioned George Selwyn to call him <em>the learned
Canary-bird</em>.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>These three Lords determined their nephew should
ask no favour of the Court; nor would they suffer
him to carry their late brother’s riband to the King,
lest his Majesty should draw any promise or professions
from so raw a lad; or lest the boy himself
should be wanting in proper respect, or be too blunt,
if the King should mention his father. Lord Frederick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
as of the Bedchamber to the Duke of Cumberland,
was the only one of the family that since
their brother’s disgrace had gone to Court: he
therefore was thought most proper to restore the
badge of the Order. At the same time, lest they
should be taxed with rudeness, they desired Lord
Besborough to thank Sandwich, but beg he would
not neglect the interests of his friend. On this
Sandwich ordered the patent to be drawn for Lord
Corke; but Lord Mansfield, fearing the loss of that
feather might root the Cavendishes in Opposition,
prevailed to have it retarded. When Lord Frederick
carried the Garter, the King used many expressions
of concern for the death of the late Duke. Lord
Frederick replied, his Majesty had not had a better
subject, and that the family had never imputed
their brother’s disgrace to his Majesty’s own
movements.</p>

<p>Having foreseen the death of the Duke of Devonshire,
and apprehending that it would break up and
dissolve our party, I determined to know if we
had anything farther to trust to. During the summer
I had had frequent conversations with Lord
Lyttelton, who was on good terms again with Mr.
Pitt and Lord Temple, and who really admired
Conway. Lord Lyttelton’s object was to reconcile
George Grenville and his brothers, and to make a
coalition between that whole family and the Opposition,
with or without the Bedfords, but totally to
the exclusion of Lord Bute. No man so addicted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
to wisdom was less wise than Lord Lyttelton; no
man so propense to art was less artful; no man
staked his honesty to less purpose, for he was so
awkward that honesty was the only quality that
seemed natural to him. His cunning was so often
in default, that he was a kind of beacon that warned
men not to approach the shallows on which he
founded his attachments, always at a wrong season.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
Mr. Pitt had neither tasted his views nor
reasons; and Lord Temple, who was growing less
disinclined to his brother George, neither trusted
Lord Lyttelton with that secret, nor with the growing
coolness between him and Mr. Pitt. On this
miscarriage I resolved to feel my way myself, and
went to Stowe. My doubts, if any remained, were
there fully cleared away. I discovered that Lord
Temple had no influence, scarce any intercourse
with Mr. Pitt; and, though he endeavoured to slide
over that coolness, I was determined to fathom it;
and did. I said I had prayed Lord Lyttelton to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
bring about an interview between Mr. Conway and
Mr. Pitt; that the latter wanted a second in the
House of Commons, and could have no man so confidential,
trusty, or creditable, as the former; that I
was sorry to find no disposition to union in his
Lordship’s friends; and that though I would try
my utmost till Christmas to cement our party, I
should give over a foolish and hopeless opposition,
if I met encouragement nowhere.</p>

<p>Lord Temple endeavoured to explain away this
coolness, and said Lord Lyttelton was so newly
reconciled to them that Mr. Pitt had not talked
openly to him; but, continued he, if Conway had
not been turned out, we should now have no
Opposition—intimating, that my zeal was founded
on resentment, not on any attachment to him and
Mr. Pitt; and though with regard to himself this
was most true, it was most unadvised arrogance in
him to drop these words to me (as he did),—“Conway
did not resign for us.” At the same
time he was profuse of incendiary volubility, and
of compliments to myself, particularly on my not
only having overlooked Wilkes’s attacks,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> but in
voting for him. We agreed in our sentiments,
that there should be a select junto of the ablest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
men in the House of Commons to conduct the
party. “Still, my Lord,” said I, “we should have
difficulties even there: the Duke of Cumberland
would object to the admission of Lord George
Sackville to our councils.” Lord Temple answered
abruptly, “We must not have a Prince of the blood
for first Minister; that would entirely alienate the
King.” This sentence explained the Duke of Cumberland’s
complaints of Mr. Pitt’s coldness to all
his overtures. I replied, I wished no more than
his Lordship to see the Duke Minister; but he
was of great credit to our party, and his life too
precarious to make him formidable: “but,” said
I, “I was speaking of Lord George”—“Oh!”
interrupted he, “there are very, very great difficulties
about Lord George: he must make his own
way before we can do anything for him.”</p>

<p>I was so offended at this royal style of <em>we</em> and
<em>us</em>, and saw so plainly that Lord Temple, though he
would be glad of our bearing him on our shoulders
to St. James’s, could not even disguise his little
inclination to us, that I determined to disappoint
him, and forbear all connexion both with Mr. Pitt
and him. I acquainted Mr. Conway with the ill-success
of this visit; and here too, as usual, had
a pill of mortification to swallow. Provoked at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
Lord Temple’s discourse, he wished, he said, I had
not gone so far: Mr. Pitt should come to him;
he would not go to Mr. Pitt; nor liked to be
thought to court anybody. I replied that it was
with his consent I had proposed that interview to
Lord Lyttelton; that I should never wish my friend
to court men in power: overtures of union to men
out of power were different; nor was there any
sense in opposing without union. I told him we
must either form as strong a party as we could,
or give up the game. We could do better without
Pitt than he without us; for he would never
dare alone and unfollowed to trust himself with
Lord Bute. Our business was to serve our country
and preserve our characters. I had staked everything,
and valued not my fortune; but I did value
my character, my understanding, and my ease; nor
would expose my sense by a tame, middling, now-and-then
opposition. That I would make no peace
with the Ministers, but would go abroad, if I could
not find more activity and more sense, than I had
met with hitherto. Conway replied (unfeelingly
enough as to me), that for himself he was independent:
he could wait; and supposed, if not soon,
something would turn up at last. That he would
oppose occasionally, but did not think it reasonable
to say, It shall do now, or I will not try. This
was a true picture of us both. I had embarked
him and myself on principle, and without consideration;
had gone on with redoubled zeal when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
saw him injured; and now was impatient to repair
the effects of my own rashness. He had been
drawn in without knowing it, and had continued
to act by system; could not bear to own, even to
me, how deeply he felt the wound he had received;
but was as much too much undisguised, on the
other hand, in letting me perceive how little he
felt the force of the sacrifice I had made to him.
In this, and all his conversations, he dwelt on his
obligations to the Dukes of Devonshire and Grafton.
I said I respected their characters, but could
not content myself with so narrow a bottom. He
said, he thought himself bound in honour to acquaint
Charles Townshend with what had passed.
I said, it would immediately make him leave us;
but I should not object to it, if he thought this
strange delicacy honourable or necessary. He said
he should not talk farther of it, nor appear cool
to Mr. Pitt, lest it should be said that he had paid
court to him, and was angry at the disappointment.
He would have no opportunity, I told him, of showing
either anger or civility to Mr. Pitt; but if he
acquainted Townshend, all the world would know
what had passed. He did write to Townshend the
whole account.</p>

<p>I was now reduced to as disagreeable a situation
as can well be conceived. I had, from a point of
honour, and from ancient friendship, gone all lengths
for a man who I perceived had much more system
than warmth of affection. My secrets were communicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
to a babbler; and it would be known
that I had tried every quiver to wound the Ministers,
without finding a single arrow to my purpose.
The only thing that remained to do, I did—I kept
my temper; and neither let Conway nor any man
else suspect the mortifications I underwent. It had
been double pleasure to my enemies to know I was
not content with <em>him</em>; and to have let <em>him</em> know it,
had disappointed the purposes to which I might still
apply him both for his sake and my own. I wished
to repair the hurt I had done him; nor till that was
effected, could I accomplish my own object of withdrawing
myself entirely from politics. The only
notice I therefore took of what had passed, was at
times to declare to Conway and others of the party,
that I was so little satisfied with the conduct of the
Opposition, that though I would never desert them
while they remained oppressed, yet was I determined
to take my leave of them as a party the moment, if
ever that moment should arrive, in which they should
be successful. This declaration I afterwards found
as satisfactory to myself as it had been honest to
those with whom I acted; and how much I was in
earnest in making this resolution, my adherence to
it will demonstrate.</p>

<p>There was perhaps a greater difficulty attending
us than all I have mentioned, though not very
likely to befall us. It was, what answer we should
make to a question Lord John Cavendish very sensibly
put to me in one of our conversations. “If we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
do get the better,” said he, “whom can we make
Ministers?” It had been to no purpose to answer,
“I do not care whom.” Unless we could form an
Administration, we must remain in Opposition. The
event did happen; we were offered, and could not
furnish out a Ministry; and yet it once more fell
into our hands by a concourse of ridiculous circumstances,
that if they do not ennoble History, yet
render it perhaps more entertaining than revolutions
of more serious complexion.</p>

<p>There happened at this time, in another country,
an event of which I shall take some notice, though
it had no relation to our affairs. The deposed Czar,
John of Muscovy, had been confined from his youth,
and, as it was said, had had drugs administered to
him destructive of his intellects. He had been
spared, however, during the long reign of his rival
Elizabeth; and had even been visited by her short-lived
successor, Peter the Third. This visit might
perhaps have awakened some sentiments in favour
of Ivan in Russian breasts; at least jealousy in that
of the foreign murderess, who now reigned in the
room of both.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> On a sudden it was given out, that
one Mirowitz had forced himself into the castle
where Ivan was imprisoned, intending to deliver
and proclaim him Emperor, but that so great was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
the fidelity and circumspection of the governor, that
he had instantly cut the poor young Prince to pieces.
This tale, almost as improbable as horrid, was believed
by the greater number, and supported by a
parade of forms and manifestos. Mirowitz was tried
by the senate, and beheaded, after reading a confession
consonant to the story divulged. His accomplice,
for <em>one</em> they did allow him to have had,
was said to have made his escape, and to have been
drowned in his flight crossing a river. As Mirowitz
suffered death unaccompanied with the torments
used in that country, it is no forced construction
to suppose he was threatened with torture if he
did not authenticate what was required of him; or
deceived with hopes of pardon, and prevented by
sudden execution before he could recal a false confession.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
Whatever was the truth, the Empress
had given such earnest of her bold and remorseless
nature in the assassination of her husband, that no
wonder she was suspected of being as deeply concerned
in the death of Ivan. I was assured by the
Duchess of Choiseul, wife of the first Minister of
France, that a French physician who had been at
Petersburg at the time, and employed at that Court,
had told her that they who knew most believed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
the death of the Empress Elizabeth had been hastened
too by the arts of Catherine: yet this fell
character did Voltaire and the Literati of France
select as the patroness of philosophy and toleration!
She had artfully been generous to a few of
them; and a poet and an author will go as far in
whitewashing a munificent tyrant, as a Cossack or
Calmuck in fighting for those who pay him. From
Augustus to Catherine the Second, no liberal usurper
has ever wanted an ode or a panegyrist. The
Duchess of Choiseul, who had an excellent heart
and solid understanding, being provoked at the
scandalous encomiums poured forth by Voltaire on
so black a character, wrote an answer to him with
equal sense, spirit, and reason; a work, in her situation,
improper to be seen: I was one of a very
few that had the satisfaction of reading it.</p>

<p>On the 1st of November the sentence of outlawry
was pronounced against Wilkes; and on
the 4th died that bacchanalian bard, his friend
Churchill. He was on a visit to his friend Wilkes
at Boulogne, where his excesses threw him into a
fever, and where he died in a few days with
epicurean indifference—a meteor that had shone
but four years, and never so brightly as he might
have done. He had wished, he said, for an opportunity
of satirizing Mr. Pitt and Charles Townshend,
who had not yet entirely listed themselves
with the Court, the moment for which Churchill
waited impatiently; yet, writing as he did at random,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
it was a chance whether he would have
touched or not the true blemishes and characteristic
marks of men so compounded of defects and
exquisite ingredients. Churchill could hew out a
block that would brave time, and last to posterity,
but stood not near enough to seize the lineaments
and shades that distinguish a portrait, and exhibit
a resemblance to the eyes of cotemporaries.</p>

<p>Among Churchill’s papers was found a collection
of letters from Lord Holland to Francis,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> who had
furnished them to the Satirist against his late
patron. In one of those epistles Francis complained
of Lord Holland for not making him an
Irish Bishop, and threatened to publish something
that would prove Lord Holland a still greater villain
than the world believed him. To silence that
wretch, Lord Holland sent him 500<i>l.</i>, and gave him
a place in Chelsea College.</p>

<p>The death of the Master of the Rolls happening
at this time, Norton was appointed to succeed him,
with an additional pension of 1200<i>l.</i> a year; and
Mr. Charles Yorke again consented to accept his
former post of Attorney-General: on which the
Duke of Cumberland said shrewdly, “We have
lost a man of character, but they have not gained
one.” This arrangement, however, did not take
place. The Chancellor<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> objected to Norton for
Master of the Rolls; and Charles Yorke was frightened<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
with the offence taken at his deserting the
Duke of Newcastle and his friends. Norton remained
Attorney; Sewell was appointed Master
of the Rolls; and Yorke accepted a patent of
precedence over the Solicitor-General;<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> which only
showed that he had made his peace without mending
his fortune.</p>

<p>About the same time was published a pamphlet,
perhaps the ablest ever written, called an “Inquiry
into the Doctrine concerning Libels.” It
severely took to pieces the arbitrary maxims of
Lord Mansfield and Norton, who were roughly
handled, as well as the late Lord Hardwicke. Dunning,
a rising lawyer, was supposed the principal
author, assisted by the Lord Chief Justice Pratt,
and one or two others.</p>

<p>On the 19th died Stone, the famous Primate
of Ireland, aged 57, having ruined his constitution
by indulgence to the style of luxury and drinking
established in Ireland, and by conforming to which
he had found the means of surmounting the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
grievous prejudices and of gaining popularity, ascendant,
power: an instance of abilities seldom to
be matched. He was aided, too, by several virtues:
he was generous and charitable, and of a soul above
revenge. When Lord Chesterfield<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> held the government
of Ireland, he told the Primate, “My
Lord, you must govern this kingdom, for you have
the best parts in it; but you want one thing, you
must take orders:” alluding to the irregularity of
his life. But Stone had greater parts than Lord
Chesterfield imagined, for he <em>did</em> govern that kingdom
without conforming to the decencies of his
profession.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>Stone was survived but a few days by his ancient
competitor the Earl of Shannon<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>—a more common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
character, he having sold his patriotism for a peerage;
and maintaining by hypocrisy an influence that
Stone had supported with the boldness of a statesman,
and with scorn of the little knavery that he
might have borrowed from his rank of Archbishop.</p>

<p>The noise which our succession of Patriots had
made in Europe, and the disgrace their prostitution
had brought on the character, gave occasion to the
following anecdote. Monsieur Elie de Beaumont,
renowned for his defence of the family of Calas,
was in England, and went to Bath. Conversing
there with Lord Chief Justice Pratt and Lord
Strange, Monsieur de Beaumont said he wanted
to see a Patriot. Lord Strange replied, there was
no such thing. “You surprise me, my Lord, said
the Chief Justice; till now I thought your Lordship
one!”</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the year the Cider counties
instructed their members to join the Minority;
and Sir George Yonge<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> carried a letter from some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
of the chiefs to the Duke of Newcastle, proposing
union. The Duke sent the letter to Mr. Pitt, as
an inducement to him to declare himself. Pitt
thanked the Duke for the communication, but
observed, the letter had not been intended for him
(Pitt). He desired to be consulted no more, for
he was, and would be, a single man. The Minority,
he said, had heard the late glorious war abused the
last session, and had sat silent. Therefore would
he join nobody, but would act on every single
occasion as he should think right.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> Thus, without
chiefs, numbers, or union, were we left to meet the
opening of Parliament in the ensuing year!</p>

<p>The primacy of Ireland being vacant, Mr. Grenville
was desirous of procuring that dignity for Dr.
Newton, Bishop of Bristol; but he declining it, Lord
Granby solicited Grenville’s interest for Dr. Ewer,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>
who had been his tutor, and Grenville intended to
bestow that mitre on him. In the meantime it was
known that Lord Northumberland espoused Robinson,
Bishop of Kildare, and sought to make him
Archbishop. This was immediately considered as
a contest for power between the Favourite and the
nominal Minister,—for that Grenville was only <em>nominal</em>
Minister, appeared by Robinson’s obtaining the
Archbishoprick; though when Grenville found he
could not obtain it for Ewer, he had maliciously and
artfully instigated the Duke of Bedford to solicit for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
Bishop Carmichael,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> who being a Scot, his promotion
would have struck mankind as the act of Lord Bute,
more than the appointment of Robinson, whom he
really supported. The intrigues of the late Primate
had been so noxious and troublesome to the English
Government, that it was determined no future Archbishops
of Armagh should be Lords Justices, or have
any power in the Administration. The new Primate,
a proud but superficial man, had not talents
to recover the credit enjoyed by his predecessors.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>January 10th,—the Parliament met. The King
notified to the two Houses the intended marriage
of his youngest sister, the Princess Caroline Matilda,
with the Prince Royal of Denmark, her first
cousin. Princess Louisa, her eldest sister, was so
remarkably small of her age, that, though she lived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
three years after this, she never appeared but as an
unhealthy child of thirteen or fourteen years of age.
Lord Townshend and Lord Bottetort moved the
address of the Lords; Lord Warkworth and T.
Pitt, of the Commons. An accidental debate happening
in the latter House, General Conway, to the
surprise of everybody, and particularly of me, who
had with astonishment beheld his tranquillity, broke
out on his own dismission, and attacked George
Grenville with a fire, eloquence, and rapidity of passion
and bitterness, that showed both how much he
had resented and how much he had concealed. Very
warm words passed between them; great applause
was given to Conway by the Opposition; and the
Ministers felt that the vengeance they had exerted
began to lose something of its sweetness. They
had infused a spirit into Conway with which all his
friends would in vain have endeavoured to inspire
him.</p>

<p>On the 15th, the King sent another message to
both Houses, referring to their consideration an offer
made by France to pay 670,000<i>l.</i>, in three years,
for our maintenance of their prisoners, instead of
1,100,000<i>l.</i>, which had been settled, but with no
specification of time, by the late peace. This offer
was accepted on a subsequent day.</p>

<p>About the same time happened the following
extraordinary event. Sir William Pynsent, a baronet
of Somersetshire, died and left his whole fortune to
Mr. Pitt, no ways related, nor personally known to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
him. Nor, as it appeared, was this great legacy so
much the reward of his illustrious services as of his
opposition to General Warrants. Sir William Pynsent,
at his death, was aged 86, had formerly served
in Parliament, and had voted against the Treaty of
Utrecht; his principles being zealously and unalterably
Whig. He was said to have had parts
and humour.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> * * * * * *
Lord North had married his next relation<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>—had
courted him, and stood fair to be his heir;<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> till,
having voted for the tax on cyder, Sir William, who
had long lived retired upon his estate, had not only
quarrelled with his cousin North, but had encouraged
the mob to burn him in effigy. He then became
enamoured of Mr. Pitt; is said to have cast
some inconstant glances towards Wilkes, and, immediately
before his death, had indubitably given
orders to his lawyer, to draw a new will entirely in
favour of General Conway; but it was not prepared
in time. Mr. Pitt, therefore, found himself in possession
of real and personal estates worth above forty
thousand pounds, without the regret of losing a
friend; without the imputation of having flattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
his benefactor, for he had never seen him; without
injuring a family, for Sir William had no very near
relation,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> and not one that expected his fortune;
and with the satisfaction of owing such a public
mark of esteem to his own virtue or merits.</p>

<p>On the 18th a meeting of the Opposition was
held at Sir George Saville’s, to consult whether
they should bring on, or defer for some time longer,
a renewal of the question on General Warrants.
The doubt was raised by the ill health of Mr. Pitt.
James Grenville and a nephew of Lord Chief Justice
Pratt, who attended the meeting, would not say
that Mr. Pitt desired the motion should be deferred.
The company squabbled till two in the morning,
and then agreed to adjourn the measure. Sir William
Meredith wrote to acquaint George Grenville
with this procrastination—a ridiculous piece of candour,
and received properly by Grenville, who made
no answer. These assemblies I seldom or never attended;
they were childish imitations of Parliaments,
rarely produced any good, and only taught a party to
quarrel and split into <em>less</em> factions. Many who cannot
utter in the House of Commons can prattle in a private
room. Business can never be reduced to too
few heads. There should, in party as well as in
Government, be one man who should consult others
separately, and act as he finds best from the result
of that advice, and of his own judgment: but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
he should let the rest know as little as possible
that they are almost all probably of different
opinions.</p>

<p>On the 21st, Dowdeswell proposed to reduce the
sixteen thousand seamen to eleven thousand, but
without effect. On the contrary, Charles Townshend
spoke for the larger number in warm terms, and
declared he had always approved the peace. This
desertion did not surprise me: nor was it owing
solely to his fickleness. He was now influenced by
Lord George Sackville, who, dissatisfied with Lord
Bute for not supporting him, had joined the Opposition:
Oppositions are always great whitewashers.
But the declining state of the Opposition, by deaths
and other causes which I have mentioned, had
alarmed Lord George, and he began to look towards
Grenville, who would want all manner of strength
to support himself against the Favourite.</p>

<p>On Jan. 23rd, the day of voting the army for the
year, there happened a very spirited debate.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> Beckford
began it, by declaring that if any man would
second him, he would oppose so large a number as
16,000 men, because we were in no danger of being
attacked by surprise; and because he apprehended
there was an intention of modelling the army, which
he concluded from the dismission of General Conway.
He mentioned, too, an expression dropped by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
Charles Townshend, which he said had made his ears
tingle; it was that the <em>Colonies were not to be emancipated</em>.
The Colonies, said Beckford, are more free
than Ireland, for America had not been conquered:
on the contrary, it was inhabited by the conquerors.
Townshend ridiculed Beckford’s alarm, affirming he
had only meant that the Colonies were not to be
emancipated from their dependence on the supremacy
of this country. Beckford told him he had
expressed a single idea by a multitude of circumlocutions,
and was troubled with a <em>diarrhœa of words</em>—an
expression with which Townshend was much hurt.</p>

<p>Nicholson Calvert and George Onslow opened on
the dismission of Conway in very strong terms. The
former said, Grenville<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> had avowed it was for parliamentary
conduct when he owned he had thought himself
turned out for a similar cause. Onslow called
the Ministers profligate and abandoned; and Lord
Strange attempting to defend them, was so roughly
handled on his own tergiversations by Onslow, Sir
George Saville, and Thomas Townshend, that he
who was wont to be all spirit, quickness, and fire,
was quite abashed, and showed at least the sensibility
of virtue. Thomas Townshend went farther,
mentioned a list of sixteen officers, carried into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
closet for dismission by Lord Sandwich: and seeing
the latter sitting under the gallery, he turned
towards him, and said he would tell that Minister
to his face in any private company, that he was a
profligate Minister. Onslow added, that they had
been so cowardly as to wait for the end of the session,
and skulk behind the recess.</p>

<p>Rigby said the Opponents had quoted all the
reigns to the last, but had stopped short there, and
had not mentioned Sir Robert Walpole, who had
said it must be a pitiful Minister that would not
dare to turn out a man that voted against him. For
himself, he said he did not believe the question of
Mr. Conway’s dismission would be brought on;
which Lord John Cavendish assured him it would
be.</p>

<p>Lord Harry Poulet<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> told Grenville that he would
be ashamed to show his face, if he could be ashamed
of anything, if his uncle Lord Cobham<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> could rise
from the dead—Grenville stopped him, and said if his
Lordship had a mind to use such language, he knew
where to find him.—Others interposing to reconcile
them, Grenville acknowledged he had thrown
out a challenge; but at last explained it away, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
the matter ended. Ellis indiscreetly affirmed that
the army was necessary to support the civil magistrate.
Beckford replied, that at the late riot on burning
the North Briton, the magistrates of the City had
secured one of the rioters without military force.</p>

<p>Grenville entered into a long discussion of the
Crown’s prerogative of dismission; and confounded
civil and military officers, without making the necessary
distinction, that the latter lose a profession.
He himself, he said, had not inquired formerly why
he was turned out. Should he be turned out <em>to-morrow</em>,
he would not inquire, <em>though if he did his
duty and was approved by his country, he should think
it extraordinary</em>. This sentence, seemingly incoherent
with, nay, contradictory to, the rest of his
speech, was, no doubt, levelled at Lord Bute, and
dictated by the uneasiness of Grenville’s situation,
then not generally known. He proceeded to say on
the dismissed officers that some might think one
meritorious, some another; others might see cause
of blame. This invidious hint called up General
Conway, who with exceeding warmth and spirit
made one of his most admired speeches. He had
asked, he said, for a court-martial, that, if anything
had been thought defective in his conduct, he might
be questioned on it. The refusal had proved that
his dismission had flowed from no military offence.
Even in the days of Charles II. the Lords Clarendon
and Southampton had, though requested by the
King to forbear, spoken against his measures, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
yet had not been dismissed.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> The situation of
officers was grievous; called on by conscience and by
honour, they were chastised if not obedient. Another
profession was more fortunate; Bishops were
made for life; and, indeed, were piously obsequious;
they might be preferred for their behaviour in Parliament,
but could not be dismissed for it. He himself
had received intimations to take care what he
did—Grenville started!—yet he should not say from
what quarter; he would not reveal what was not
proper; but he had been bid to take care what he
did. He had despised those menaces, had done his
duty, and had been punished. He knew the threats
had not come from the King, who had restored Sir
Henry Erskine. He had made, he said, a declaration
that he was attached to no party, yet that allegiance,
it seemed, had not been thought sufficient.
He concluded with strongly exhorting his brother
officers not to be made slaves—he might as well
have called on the Bishops.</p>

<p>This debate was doubly mortifying to the Ministers,
who were at once so rudely tasked by the
Opposition, and unsupported by every man of the
Favourite’s faction—a tacit method of disavowing
them; and an encouragement to those who might
be tempted to oppose them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
On the 26th Mr. Chaworth, a private gentleman
of fair character, was killed at a tavern by Lord Byron
in a duel, to which the latter had been driven by
the undisguised contempt with which the former
had treated his want of honour and spirit at a club
where they had just dined together. Lord Byron was
formally tried by his Peers,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> and escaped punishment,
in consideration of the provocation he had received.</p>

<p>On the 29th the question of General Warrants was
again renewed in the House of Commons by Sir William
Meredith,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> more agreeably, indeed, to principle
than to prudence. I had endeavoured to divert the
attempt and had the concurrence of the Lord Chief
Justice Pratt’s opinion, we both apprehending, from
the great diminution of our party since the preceding
winter, that, as we should make a much more inconsiderable
figure on a division in Parliament than we
had done before on the same question, the merits
of the cause would suffer more from that defeat
than we should gain by reviving the memory of it.
Though the event in the House proved what we
had foreseen, we found, however, strength enough
to support a battle till between four and five in the
morning. Sir W. Meredith, with great force and
severity, exposed the conduct of Lord Halifax, who
shamefully to that hour (and indeed for some years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
afterwards) defeated all prosecutions against him at
Wilkes’s suit, by standing on the privilege of his
peerage. If they, said Sir William, who issued the
warrants, had put themselves on the justice of their
country, it would have alleviated their guilt; but
<em>while the privilege of the House of Commons was given
up, the privilege of the other House had interfered to
stop justice</em>. He then moved that <em>General Warrants
were not consonant to law or to the liberty of
the subject</em>; and in a second question, <em>if against a
Member</em>. Lord Strafford himself, he said, had issued
but one, had pleaded that it was according to practice,
and yet had recalled it. Charles II. had applied
to Parliament for leave to do it by the Licensing
Act. Application had been made in King William’s
reign to renew that act, but it was refused.
Some said the illegality was decided by the law;
others that it was not. Some would say that the
House of Commons was not to declare what was
law. Who could bring it to an issue? Dryden
Leach and other printers were ruined, and could
not carry on the suit! Wilkes expelled, outlawed,
banished, had no longer any interest in the question:
the Secretaries of State did not desire to brine it to
any issue; the House of Commons alone could do
it. Sir Edward Coke declared, that, when courts of
law would not decide on a clear question, the House
of Commons ought. Sir Alexander Gilmour added,
that not one lawyer, last year, had defended the legality
of General Warrants, but had given assurances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
that they would be decided in the Courts below;
and yet that decision had been postponed till Wilkes
had been outlawed.</p>

<p>Dr. Hay replied with much and able subtlety;
owned that when he was for putting off the question
last year he had meant to reject it; his party had
said that it was not proper for that House to declare
on law; he himself had said those warrants were
illegal, unless great urgency in their favour.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> He
agreed that, by the common law of the land, those
warrants were illegal: nay, he thought the question
ought to be settled by Parliament, not by a resolution
of one House only. Sir William had omitted
the words <em>seditious</em> and <em>treasonable</em>, though adopted
last year. The House might do what it pleased, but
ought it to do so? Why not make the case general
to all cases? Then this resolution, he heard, was
to be followed by another on breach of privilege;
but was every injury to a member a breach of privilege?
Was the House to be an universal judicatory
for offences? But the House had already declared
that it has no privilege in the case of seditious and
treasonable libels—a question of law is safe in courts
of law; but Houses of Commons, not being permanent,
may vary their resolutions. One House—both
Houses cannot declare laws, though they, with the
King, may enact laws. The question had either been
adjudged, or was pending: both were true. The
Court of Common Pleas had decided and given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
damages; then he named the Chief Justice Pratt,
taking notice of the strong expression of <em>an iron rod</em>,
used by that magistrate on the occasion. All juries
say General Warrants are illegal; but at present the
question had been hung up by the bill of exceptions,
which bills are in the nature of appeals—an argument
why the House should not, at that time, make a declaration.
If there had been delay, why was not the
offender called on? He had heard that the delay arose
from the prosecutors. If anything was done wrong
in the Courts below, the House alone could redress it.
He then, as a correction to the proposed question,
moved the following strange and scarce intelligible
sentence (to load the motion ridiculously, and
with intention to reject afterwards the question so
amended), “That in the particular case of libels, it
is proper and necessary to fix, by a vote of this
House only, what ought to be deemed the law in
respect of General Warrants; and for that purpose,
at the time when the determination of the legality
of such warrants, in the instance of a most seditious
and treasonable libel, is actually depending before
the courts of law; for this House do declare that
a General Warrant for apprehending the authors,
printers, or publishers of a libel, together with their
papers, is not warranted by law, and is a high violation
of the liberty of the subject.”</p>

<p>It was requisite for me to state the words of this
proposition and account for them; for standing as
they do on the printed votes without a comment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
what could posterity, or persons ignorant of parliamentary
craft and proceedings, think of them? Would
they believe such a proposition was seriously debated?—yet,
as the votes never joke, could they avoid
believing so? The fact, as I have said, was, that
the Ministry, to load Sir William Meredith’s question
with absurdity, made use of their power, as the
majority, thus to amend the question, and forced the
opponents to debate it thus hampered, or withdraw
it; and even the latter could not be done without
leave of the House, that is of the majority, who probably
would not have granted that permission, that
they might give a negative to the question thus
loaded, instead of rejecting Sir W. Meredith’s plain
question, which it would have been more unpopular
to do. By the strict rules of the House they could
even have obliged the debate to be pursued on the
question only as amended; but, content with the
certainty of rejecting it in their own way, they suffered
the Opposition to argue on the simple state of
the case, and the debate accordingly proceeded so.
Lord Middleton asked if the Petition of Rights had
not come in by declaration? and, with regard to the
charge of delay, he said the plaintiffs could not afford
to go on with the bill of exceptions, and then were
accused of protracting; and, to justify the renewal
of the question, he observed that Lord Coke says,
“Many a good proposition had succeeded at last by
being pursued year after year.” Sir W. Meredith
said, he had omitted the word <em>seditious</em>, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
question might carry no reference to Wilkes, being
calculated for the general and indefinite good of all.
No epithets ought to be mixed with prosecutions,
nor should a man be liable to be prosecuted as a
traitor for having written a libel. No privilege held
against treason; but the House ought not to be deprived
of its members on a false charge of treason.
Conway asked if Hay had been serious in his motion?
did he mean his amendment should go out into the
world on so important a question? It would be
a mockery of Parliament. Grenville called him to
order; but Conway persisted and said it would be
a shameful proceeding. Wedderburn and the Solicitor-General
again interrupted him; but he was
supported by Sir George Saville and Onslow; and
the Speaker declared there was nothing disorderly
in Conway’s words. Dowdeswell said, Dr. Hay had
argued on the whole question, therefore he would;
but Lord Frederick Campbell endeavouring to fix
the debate on the question as amended, Charles
Townshend tried to compose the heat that had arisen
by recurring to the subject, and said he hoped no
lawyer would assert that juries were not judges of
law as well as of fact. De Grey, Solicitor-General,
said the juries had given the prosecutors exemplary
and vindictive damages, and had been animated by
faction. The defendants had pressed the prosecutors
not to delay. Charles Yorke spoke for three-quarters
of an hour on the side of the Opposition;
said he would retract if he had altered his opinion;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
but found reasons against the warrants growing all
over the kingdom. The warrant had been so <em>emphatically
illegal</em>, that it never could be debated in a
court of law. It was expedient for Parliament and
for the honour of the Crown, that Parliament should
take the lead in questions of law. The House of
Commons had often carried up resolutions to the
other House. This question was connected with the
privileges of the House. Precedents made in good
times were felt in bad. The words of the warrant
had been copied from an old blundering warrant of
office, and could never be taken up again. The
Crown should extinguish any jealousy of such a proceeding
in future, by not making difficulties on plain
questions. Beckford said, this country was obliged
to Wilkes for the stand he had made. It had been
the more necessary when a Whig Ministry acted
on Tory principles, and he quoted the instance of
Minutius, who pleaded that he had written nothing
against the Emperor and <em>his mother</em>.</p>

<p>Dyson said, if the House of Commons had a right
of declaring law, it had no occasion to make laws:
they might declare to be law whatever they wished
should be so. Lord George Sackville asked if the
seizure of papers would come in question in the
Courts below? and said, that, had they had a mind
to impeach the Secretaries of State, they must previously
have come to this declaration.</p>

<p>Norton entered into the defence of Lord Halifax,
whose delays, he said, had not impeded the decision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
of the great cause. Lord Halifax had been guilty
of a slip; and therefore, against such a prosecutor
as Wilkes, was justifiable. Lord Halifax had availed
himself of his privilege, till Wilkes was outlawed,
(and so he did for years after); the journeymen
printers had applied to be bought off. Dryden
Leach’s attorney had come to him (Norton), and
said he had heard it was wished to compromise
Leach’s cause; but he (Norton) had refused, but
had offered to bring it to an issue in a week; since
then had never heard of him. Till that very day
they had not been able to get the bill of exceptions
sealed. Charles Yorke had said that question had
never been argued; but he (Yorke) had argued it
himself. (This Yorke denied.) It would be a
quære whether Lord Halifax, as Secretary of State,
was a Justice of Peace. Had not the most respectable
characters, living and dead, been abused? That
sort of libel deserved no quarter.</p>

<p>Colonel Barré said the Inquisition itself did not
seize papers for evidence. Opposition keeps Ministers
in order, though many oppose from faction.
About twenty officers had opposed the Court last
year on the question of General Warrants! It was
now said, all but one had repented—if they had,
were such officers fit to be employed? He commended
Lord Nuneham<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> and Lord Charles Spencer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
who had resisted the connections and importunities
of their families: and then said ironically, “When
the two present honest Secretaries of State<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> die, the
Court may choose one of the most profligate abandoned
dogs in the kingdom to replace him.”—This
was levelled at Lord Sandwich, who was sitting
under the gallery. Barré then advised the Ministers
to adopt the question without amending it—why
would they do things too well? Such a man
as Sandwich would write a panegyric on Nero. If
this question was suffered to pass, it would make
the King beloved and the Ministers less hated.
General Howard,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> in answer to the attack above,
said, he remained of the same opinion as last year,
and had never paid court nor asked pardon.</p>

<p>Lord North defended his uncle Halifax, on whom
he thought Barré had bestowed the epithet of <em>little-minded</em>.
Barré said he had applied it to the Administration
in general. He was glad to see Mr.
Grenville with all his friends about him. It had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
been said in a foregoing debate that he had carried
the whole Administration home in his chariot. He
liked Lord North’s panegyric on one of the Secretaries—if
anybody had a mind to make a panegyric
on the other, he was welcome.</p>

<p>Conway again declared his surprise that they
would load such a question with so many words.
Why not pass it simply, or put a negative? Was
there ever an instance of such a preface with new
matter? On the Star Chamber and other grievances
each resolution stood single. Lord Halifax
might be in the right, but had caused delay. All
that we have valuable stands on resolutions.</p>

<p>Grenville then spoke his usual hour; and immediately
after him Sir George Saville rose to take
notice of most obnoxious words that had fallen from
Dr. Hay in the beginning of the debate. I hear,
said Saville, that <em>the Law of Government is superior
to the Law of the Land</em>: such words are impeachable.
Dr. Hay replied that <em>the Law of Government</em>
meant <em>the Law of Necessity</em>. This produced great
warmth and calling to order, till at last Sir George
Saville said he was glad the gentleman did not avow
those words. Hay taxing Conway with want of
temper, the latter replied, he believed those who
had meant to hurt him, had hurt themselves more.
Onslow offered to produce pamphlet for pamphlet
written by the Administration: and then Hussey
very ably and for fifty minutes discoursed against the
arbitrary tenets set up by the Court and its lawyers;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
yet still with the candour and decency peculiar
to him. The circumstances inserted in the
amendment, he said, were not true. He doubted if
ever the question could be determined in Westminster
Hall. This was the first time that ever a <em>probable</em>
cause was pleaded in behalf of General Warrants.
<em>New doctrines sprung up every day in Westminster
Hall.</em> A number of points must be determined
before that cause could be decided; as whether
a Secretary of State is a Justice of Peace;
whether his messenger is a constable; whether the
reason assigned for the commitment was a probable
cause, &amp;c. Great difficulties, too, there were in
contending with the Crown, and against its influence
and its money, &amp;c. He did not believe that the
warrants would come before the Courts below. The
predecessors of these Ministers had always compounded
such prosecutions. The Justices in Ireland
having imposed illegal oaths, the House had declared
them illegal, but went no farther; excusing the Justices
on the circumstances of the times: it was in
King William’s reign. Lord Palmerston,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> a young
man of sense, and who spoke then for the first time,
declared himself convinced by Hussey’s arguments.
Rigby pronounced Lord Halifax’s intrenching himself
within privilege, justifiable; for who knew what
damages might be given against him?—and so far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
was true; juries could impose fines to the vastest
amount; and as such fine became the property of
the prosecutor, the Crown itself could not remit it.
But what latent defects, therefore, were discovered
by agitating these questions? A Secretary of State
could commit a grievous injustice, and yet could
avoid punishment, if sheltered by the privilege of
his peerage. On the other hand, for a slight imprisonment,
a jury, naturally partial to their equals,
especially when oppressed, and as naturally averse
to their superiors, can give damages to the amount
of the defendant’s whole estate, without his being
able to obtain redress from any quarter.</p>

<p>At half an hour after four in the morning the
Question, as amended, was rejected by 224 against
185, the Opposition being forced to divide <em>for</em> the
question that had been imposed on them, or they
could have obtained a division on none at all.</p>

<p>A remarkable circumstance in the foregoing debate,
but which would have interrupted the thread
of the narration, was that Norton told the younger
Onslow that he should be diverted, for he would
treat Yorke worse than ever he had been treated—and
he kept his word, being willing to lower Yorke,
who might be his competitor for the Seals. Yorke
bore this insult with too little spirit, and thence and
by his fluctuating behaviour, and by discovering far
less parts than he was supposed to possess, daily
sunk in the estimation of the House.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang50 b2">Distinction between late Motions on General Warrants shown
in the Votes.—Dismissal of Officers.—Proceedings against
Almon deferred.—Mr. Grenville’s Resolutions.—Dr. Browne’s
Pamphlet.</p></blockquote>

<p>The next day Sir William Meredith, uneasy that
Dr. Hay’s ridiculous preface should, by being united
to his question, pass for his, proposed his difficulty
to the House, the Speaker having been so impartial
as to delay the impression of the votes. Grenville
confessed it was hard, and yielded that a distinction
should be made. Conway caught artfully at this
concession, acknowledged Grenville’s candour, owned
he had been too warm himself, but desired Ministers
to observe what difficulties were brought on gentlemen
by such unparliamentary arts. Grenville repented
his concession, and Dyson, the Jesuit of the
House, endeavoured to explain it away; but Conway
pinned them down to what had been yielded, and
the votes were so cooked as to ascribe the amendment
to the House, and distinguish it from Meredith’s
original motion.</p>

<p>Not content with this atonement, the elder Onslow,
two days afterwards, on a motion for paving the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
streets, parodied Dr. Hay’s question, but desired it
might not be printed in the votes, as none of his
constituents would understand it.</p>

<p>We of the Opposition had another business on the
anvil, as knotty and full of difficulties as the question
on General Warrants, and on which it was as
arduous to decide whether we should bring it into
Parliament or not. This was the complaint on the
dismission of officers for their parliamentary conduct.
Lord John Cavendish had pledged himself to move
it; and it would not only revive the odium against
the Ministers on a topic of such popular sound,
but the cruelty exercised on General A’Court,
deprived of his bread for a silent vote, and the
rigour shown to Conway, though so decent and conscientious,
had been particularly crying. Still there
were both solid and private objections. The all-puissance
of the Court was sure of putting a negative
on the question; and thence officers would
become still more dependent when the Crown should
be thus authorized to cashier them at pleasure, by
the approbation of Parliament. Charles Yorke and
Charles Townshend were afraid of a debate that would
reduce them to quit their allies before they had
made their peace, or to oppose the Crown on so
favourite a branch of prerogative as that of holding
a scourge over its dependents. The Duke of Richmond,
though he had promised, if the question
should be stirred, to take part for Conway, could not
wish for the occasion of differing with an Administration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
with whom, on every other point, he was
united; and the officers in general, though they
would have rejoiced to be emancipated from their
dependence, were as little desirous of seeing a topic
agitated, which would have obliged them to approve
the practice, or exposed them to the resentment
of the Crown, with the certainty, at the same
time, that a censure of the practice could not be
obtained by so weak an Opposition. Nor, hurt as I
was at the treatment of my friend, could I myself
wish to have the matter discussed in Parliament,
where, by voting against the measure of dismissing
officers for their conduct in the House, I must in
fact have condemned my father, who had used the
same severity, though on far higher provocation, and
against determined opponents. Even Conway himself,
aware that he should be deserted by his brethren,
the officers, was by no means eager for bringing
on the question. In this dilemma, Lord Temple
advised Lord John to go to Hayes, and learn of Mr.
Pitt whether, if they should defer the motion, he
should be for it, when he should be able to come
forth. This very advice indicated that Lord Temple
at that time knew not Mr. Pitt’s mind, and wished
to learn it for his own private reasons. Mr. Pitt’s
answer then, and his change on the same occasion
afterwards, marked that at that hour he had received
no overtures from the Court, and that afterwards he
probably had, as will be seen. Lord John went to
Hayes, and found Mr. Pitt in bed with the gout.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
Pitt said he knew not when he should be able to
come to the House: if he could he should be
warmly with the Opposition; yet he feared too
many negatives on that question would authorize
the Court to dismiss officers. He condemned the
practice strongly; and said whatever party or division
of party might prevail hereafter, he hoped,
though he grew an infirm old man, and that all was
over with him, that they would do justice, not only
to the persons dismissed, but to the principle. He
was sorry the question of the Warrants had been
stirred this year: had Opposition waited till a decision
against them had been pronounced in Westminster
Hall, not an argument in their behalf would
have remained.—When Lord John returned with
this answer, I begged him to wait, and to give out
that it was in compliment to Mr. Pitt, which would
do credit to our cause—and by delaying, I hoped to
avoid the question.</p>

<p>Almon,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> an active and officious printer for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
Opposition, and attached to Lord Temple and
Wilkes, having been prosecuted for publishing the
excellent letter on libels, appeared on February 6th,
in the King’s Bench, to show cause why an attachment
against him should not be issued. As Lord
Mansfield would not openly appear in this cause
(he himself being severely treated in that pamphlet),
as Judge Denison<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> had resigned, and the new judge
had not taken his seat, Wilmot,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> the remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
judge in that court, said, “It would be too much
for him to take upon himself.” The Attorney-General
moved to have Almon bound over to the
next term. His counsel desired he might be heard,
or dismissed; but he was bound over. This suit
was afterwards dropped when Mr. Grenville found
it convenient to have libels written <em>against</em> the
Administration.</p>

<p>The same day Onslow moved for a call of the
House for that day fortnight, that the House might
be full on the great questions of Dismission of
Officers, of Canada Bills, the Money due on the
Manilla Ransom, the Cider Tax, &amp;c.; and it was
agreed to.</p>

<p>Grenville then proposed his thirty-five resolutions<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>
towards a bill for laying duties on America,
by <em>his memorable Stamp Act</em>. This famous bill,
little understood here at that time, was less attended
to. It removed the burthen of a tax to
distant shoulders; and the most momentous acts
are seldom much discussed, when no immediate
interest occurs to oppose them. The colonies, in
truth, were highly alarmed, and had sent over representations
so strong against being taxed here,
that it was not thought decent or safe to present
their memorial to Parliament. The chief colonies
had long been increasing in power and opulence;
and wise men had not been wanting to foresee how
difficult it would become for so small an empire as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
Britain to contain them within the necessary limits
of dependence. Nor would that subjection probably
be maintained, but by garrisons and regular
forces; the charge of which, if borne by the colonies
themselves, would leave to England but a
precarious power over them; or would be too
weighty an expense on the mother-country; and
would even place a greater military force in the
hands of the Crown than would be consistent with
the freedom of this constitution; for of necessity
the troops stationed in America must be often
changed, and brought back to Britain; or might
grow too intimately connected with the colonists;
or might lose sight of all obedience but to their own
officers. Long had the colonies been neglected, or
overlooked. Sir Robert Walpole, whose maxim was,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quieta non movere</i>, had been content with seeing no
troubles arise in America. He had left that province
to its proper minister, the Duke of Newcastle,
Secretary of State, who had a closet full of despatches
from that quarter unopened for a large
number of years.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> The Board of Trade, whose department
it was, had sunk into a perfect sinecure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
for Members of Parliament; insomuch that Martin
Bladen,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> one of the commissioners, applying himself
to the duties of his office, it was said with humour,
that Bladen was <em>Trade</em>, and the other commissioners
the <em>Board</em>. Two events concurred to rouse
both the Americans and the English Government
from this lethargy. The first was the conquest of
Canada, which, delivering the colonies from apprehensions
of the French, had thus early taught them to
feel their own weight and importance. The second
was the power of the Crown being in the hands of
Grenville. It had been proposed to Sir Robert
Walpole, to raise the revenue by imposing taxes on
America; but that Minister, who could foresee beyond
the benefit of the actual moment, declared it
must be a bolder man than himself who should
venture on such an expedient. That man was
found in Grenville, who, great in daring, and little
in views, was charmed to have an untrodden field
before him, of calculation and experiment. The
opposition of the Americans touched a third string
predominant in his nature,—an obstinacy of supporting
his will and his power. In the light of
easing and improving an overburthened country and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
revenue, he was not blameable in wishing it could
be accomplished. Nor, considering how great a
debt had been incurred by supporting the colonies
in the last war, was it unreasonable to desire that
they should assist their mother in contributing to
lighten a burthen become almost too grievous to be
supported. But to this single object were all Grenville’s
views and knowledge confined. His policy
by no means embraced impediments or consequences.
To say that his plan would be confined to
the present assistance as then chalked out, was what
neither himself pretended, nor was it by any means
adequate to the mischiefs the attempt might produce.
He himself termed it but an experiment
towards farther aid, and as such the Americans immediately
understood it. Little did he weigh the
danger of a contest between the mother-country and
such distant, extensive, and now powerful subjects.
Less did he attend to the opportunity he threw into
the hands of Spain and France, of exciting a mutinous
spirit in our colonies, and when occasion
should serve, of throwing assistance into them
against their parent. Least of all did he foresee
the damage he would inflict on trade, and how far
the expected aid would be from compensating the
loss the British merchant would suffer by a quarrel
with our outlying brethren; but it was the fate of
the times I am now describing,—I mean during the
administrations of Lord Bute and Grenville,—to stir
questions which, for the happiness of the whole, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
better have slept in oblivion. The Americans soon
learned to enter upon and discuss those problems
of government, the benefits of which happy nations
had better enjoy than agitate; which, from the perversity
of man, are never universally assented to,
and consequently cannot be moved without mischief;
and which wisdom will never recal from
speculation into dispute, but when the afflictive
hand of power makes opposition to them the only
remedy left against tyranny and arbitrary will.</p>

<p>From this moment nothing was heard from America
but questions on the right of taxation, and
whether the colonists had not carried with them all
the birthrights of English freemen: whether their
assemblies were not Parliaments, and whether any
man could be taxed who was not represented. Parallels
were drawn between the Americans, Scotland,
and Ireland; and while all obedience was
acknowledged<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> to the Crown, the jurisdiction of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
British Parliament came to be undervalued, and set
at nought. Every assumption of liberty that had
been pleaded here against our kings, was now set
up against the jurisdiction of England. The overflow
of political writings in these islands had long
been transmitted for vent to America, and were now
the basis of a new paper war. Nor were there
wanting in the chief provinces men of subtle and
liberal minds, who knew how to set their pretensions
in the fairest light. Still less was there a
dearth of aspiring demagogues, who felt how much
consideration must attend real or affected patriotism.
On both sides of the ocean, there happily
were found some men of that moderate frame
of mind, who, though commonly the last to attain
credit in the loud cry of faction, were successful in
tempering the evil, though censured at home, and
but ill rewarded with the attention they merited
from America.</p>

<p>I have thus touched upon the outlines of this
ill-omened dispute. More must be said on it
hereafter; yet shall I sparingly treat a subject on
which so many volumes have been written, and
which at the moment I write<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> seems calmed—I
fear, not composed. New pretensions erected, and
the honour of old claims to be asserted, seldom
moulder away <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pulveris exigui jactu</i>. These disputes,
like all others on government, date from the foresight
always wanting in new institutions. Men talk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
of patriarchal systems, and original compacts. Necessity
and accident formed all systems, and men
were governed long before they reasoned. Where
ambition was in the govern<em>ed</em>, and wisdom and humanity
in the governors, the system proved gentle
and moderate. Where the contrary happened, power
was earlier felt. When once formed, succeeding
men were ambitious to usurp government, not to
correct it. When it grew intolerable, it was patriotism
to force it back to its principles. At last,
patriotism itself was found to be the shortest, as
it was the most plausible step to power: and the
patriot becoming the attorney for his countrymen,
proved the only winner by the gain of the cause.
When the New World was discovered, it was
parcelled out as the property of the princes whose
subjects made discoveries. The expense of settling
it, after driving out or butchering the natives,
would have been enormous: the hazard from such
long voyages and new climates, most unpromising.
To tempt their old subjects to make the experiment,
it was necessary for the European sovereigns to offer
both great and specious encouragement. From
Britain especially, where the monarch was not absolute,
he could not despatch large involuntary
embarkations. Grants of vast tracts of land were
a shining bait; and, as the fashion gained ground,
lasting privileges were superadded. Charters,
clothed with the most flattering conditions, were
liberally bestowed; and as the Crown was the sole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
dispenser of those graces, the King’s Ministers were
little likely to insert any other dependence as terms
on which the boon was granted. Assemblies were
instituted, rather in imitation of Parliaments, than as
subservient to that of the maternal empire. Little
in those faint outsets of new government was it
natural to foresee that one day or other it might
come to be wished that the line had been drawn
with more precision. Thus (as I have said, it has
happened to governments in general) conclusions
have been drawn from premises which never existed.
The Americans founded themselves on charters
greedily asked and carelessly granted; and though
I would be far from weakening written, or any established
principles, it is easy to see that, whatever
the letter of such charters may be, or the spirit on
which they were bestowed, the Legislature could not
intend they should exempt the colonies from the
jurisdiction of Parliament. I have indeed no doubt
but Elizabeth, James, and Charles would not have
been averse to establish their own authority over
new provinces, independently of Parliament: but
the question on either hand was certainly never in
contemplation. Both policy and humanity, in this
great contest between Britain and her colonies,
should rather use their efforts to reconcile their
interests, than to pronounce between them. Parliament
ought to have no ampler jurisdiction over
the colonies, than it has over the inhabitants of
Britain; nor would that be sufficient guarantee for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
the liberties of America, if Parliaments, vindicating
their authority by force, should be inclined to feel
partiality against those that had resisted its domination.
Equal claim to indulgence and lenity of
treatment with other British subjects should be
ascertained to the colonies, if under the same jurisdiction.
An unequal yoke, from whatever cause
imposed, whether under a King or a Parliament,
must be felt most by those most subjected to it.
The colonists have affected to be willing to contribute
to the aid of the whole, provided they may
tax themselves,—a pretension liable to great difficulties:
for, though to avoid dependence on British
Parliaments, they may at present choose this flattering
alternative, what security can there be that
their assemblies, thus erected into Parliaments, will
remain harmoniously ready at all times to share the
burthen? Some have demanded for the Americans
a right of sending representatives to the English
Parliament,—a question, even if acceptable to them
(which it is thought it would not be), perhaps still
more replete with danger. We know tolerably well
what a British Parliament can and cannot do: how
far it can be corrupted, how mischievous that corruption
may be, and how far the weight of the
House of Commons can operate against the two
other parts of the Legislature: but who can tell
what change in the constitution might be effectuated
by touching, by enlarging the actual existence
of that assembly? Add a great number of members;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
it may grow cheap, or too preponderant in
the scale. A large number of Americans may clog,
and clash with, every British operation. A small
number may be too potent, from the very extensive
dependencies they must enjoy in that part of the
world. A member of each province would become
its viceroy: and when we see how prodigious is the
influence of any popular orator here, though under
the eye of the Sovereign, what would be his authority
if a Pitt, or a Wilkes, were to return to America,
clothed with the mantle of disgust and patriotism?</p>

<p>These, therefore, are questions to be skinned over,
if possible, by moderate councils. On some disputes,
to pronounce is to declare battle. While undecided,
men will weary themselves and others with literary
altercation. Determine the point, and the adversaries
have recourse to the <em>means</em> of recovering the ground
they have lost. It is the kindest way of ruling men
to govern them as they will be governed, not as they
ought to be governed. The peace and happiness
and security of society is the intention of laws, and
ought to be of law-givers: and to <em>reconcile</em> is perhaps
a more amiable virtue in a patriot than to <em>reform</em>. It
has not the same glaring appendages; but carries a
more internal comfort to the man that exerts it, as
it is purchased with fewer and lighter hardships to
those in whose service it is employed.</p>

<p>When Grenville moved the resolutions, Colonel
Barré was the first, and almost the single man to oppose
them, treating severely Charles Townshend, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
supported the motion.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> Barré, Alderman Baker, and
a few more proposed to adjourn the consideration,
but were defeated by a majority of 245 against 49,
after a debate that lasted till nine o’clock. On the
15th, when the bill was brought in, Rose Fuller presented
a petition from Jamaica, desiring to be heard
against it by counsel. This Grenville, with heat
and haughtiness, opposed, as it was a petition against
a money-bill. Conway pleaded for receiving the
petition, showing the distinction between this and
taxes laid at home, where the persons to be taxed
have representatives with whom they can entrust
their interests, and who can object to any designed
burthens that may be too oppressive. Charles Yorke
made a long speech against receiving the petition;
but it was in truth a set speech in favour of the bill,
and occasionally applied to the petition. The House
ill-relishing opposition to a tax which was not to fall
on themselves, the petition was rejected, and the bill
easily passed. About the same time a petition from
the Cyder counties met with the same fate on a division
of 150 to 82.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
So triumphant was the Administration that the
very creatures of Mr. Pitt were forward to chant their
praises and stigmatize their opponents. Besides a
sermon against libels, preached on the 30th of January
by Dr. Lyttelton, Bishop of Carlisle, there
was at this time a servile tract against Faction, published
by Dr. Browne, who, a few years before, had
written a thing, called <em>An Estimate</em>, which, notwithstanding
its pert and silly positions, had met with
unaccountable success. In that piece Mr. Pitt had
been his hero. This Browne, the ape of Pope, and
who had written some poems, not without merit, had
afterwards produced two very indifferent tragedies;<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
and, lastly, an absurd treatise on Music, which he
pretended to apply to the formation of a visionary
Government. He ended his life deplorably by his
own hand in a fit of illness and madness, having been
invited to Russia to assist the Czarina in some of her
ostentatious projects on legislation, and being oppressed,
either with imaginary glory, or despondence
of supporting his reputation.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
These panegyrics, or vindications, answered no
better to the Ministers than their severity. Williams,
the re-printer of the North Briton, being sentenced
to the pillory, he went thither in a coach marked 45,
the number of the famous paper for which Wilkes
suffered, and which became his hieroglyphic with
the mob, who near the pillory erected a gallows, on
which they hanged a boot with a Scotch bonnet. At
the same time 200<i>l.</i> was collected for Williams.</p>

Informations.—Warburton.—Dismissal of Officers.—Newfoundland
and Virginia Petitions.</p></blockquote>

<p>Among Grenville’s economic projects, one was to
purchase from the Duke of Athol the sovereignty of
the Isle of Man, which was the harbour and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entrepot</i>
of the smugglers between Great Britain and
Ireland, and who were secured by the jurisdiction of
that Peer. As the Duke was unwilling to part with
his property, Grenville, well-founded in his scheme,
determined to force it from him by Act of Parliament,
or to oblige him to compound under that
terror. A bill was accordingly brought in for that
purpose, and the Duke and Duchess<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> were heard by
their counsel. Mr. Grey Cooper,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> who pleaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
their cause, made a most admired speech at the bar
of the House, and the Scotch members and the
Opposition supported the Duke’s rights. At last
the matter was adjusted by purchase of the title of
the Duke and Duchess, for which the former received
70,000<i>l.</i>, and her Grace 2000<i>l.</i> a year for life.</p>

<p>On the 20th the House was called over, as appointed;
but, Mr. Pitt not appearing, the magnificent
threats of motions which our party had thrown out,
were again laid aside, and at last dropped, from
various reasons as will be mentioned, but particularly
by the great event to which the King suddenly
falling ill gave birth.</p>

<p>Some time before his marriage the King’s face
was full of pimples. These had so entirely disappeared,
that it was apprehended he had made use of
external remedies to repel them. It is certain that
from that time he frequently laboured with disorders
on his breast, particularly during the Queen’s first
pregnancy. He was now again seized with a cough
and fever, for which he was repeatedly blooded four
times, and was apprehended to be in much danger.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
So critical a situation made men take notice that, to
secrete him from all intercourse with his Court, Lord
Bute had placed the King at Buckingham House, a
damp unwholesome spot, and rendered more perilous
by the neighbourhood of two infectious hospitals.
The vigour of his age and his sanguine constitution
seemed to require more exercise and air than he
enjoyed in that sauntering and domestic life. It was
even said that Dr. Duncan<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> advising his Majesty to
have one of his palaces in the country fitted up, and
to live there for some time, Lord Bute harshly reprimanded
the physician, and asked him what he had
to do to advise beyond his line?—a question which
reason could easily have answered, though awe might
not. After stating some intervening matters, I shall
return to this subject.</p>

<p>The Chevalier d’Eon having accused the Comte
de Guerchy of a design to have him assassinated, the
grand jury found the bill against the Ambassador.
This new insult was not more perplexing to the Ambassador
than it was to the Ministers. The latter
determined to remove the verdict by a writ of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">certiorari</i>
into the King’s Bench, and then to issue another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">noli prosequi</i>. The affront, in the meantime,
met with no support, and was soon forgotten
in the subsequent national disputes.</p>

<p>On the 4th of March, Nicholson Calvert, seconded
by Serjeant Hewet, moved the House to take from
the Attorney-General the power of informations <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex-officio</i>—a
blow intended to stigmatize Norton, as well
as to serve liberty. Mr. Conway having observed
that those popular questions only terminated in
confirming the power that was abused, had vainly
laboured to prevent the motion. Grenville and the
lawyers opposed it; and denying that the power had
been abused, urged that there was no reason for
taking it away. Charles Yorke spoke on the side
of the Court, and, after a short debate, the motion
was rejected by 204 to 78.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>Bishop Warburton,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> who thought the persecution
he had suffered from Wilkes and Churchill, his
devotion to the Ministry, and his great pre-eminence
in learning over his brethren on the Bench,
had entitled him to one of the most considerable
mitres, resented so much the promotion of Terrick
to the see of London, that, during the King’s illness,
in the King’s own chapel, he preached on neglected
merit, and, with the same modesty that shines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
through his writings, drew pictures of himself and
his rival under the distinctions of merit and demerit.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>The City of London petitioning the House of
Commons for more money for the new bridge at
Blackfriars, Lord Strange, Elliot, and Rigby opposed,
the latter saying rudely, that he did not know what
obligations the King had to the City. Grenville,
with more prudence, countenanced the petition and
procured a gift of 7000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Lord John Cavendish, impatient to fulfil his engagement,
prevailed on Lord Rockingham to go to
Hayes, and know if Mr. Pitt would come to town,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
or desired to have the motion on dismission of
officers delayed any longer. Mr. Pitt’s language
was now exceedingly altered, though he still highly
condemned the dismission of Conway. The question,
he said, touched near upon prerogative. It ought to
have been brought on early in the session; was sorry
to hear it had been reported that the question had
been postponed on his account: himself had never
advised to agitate it. Lord Rockingham even
doubted, from his inexplicit conversation, whether,
if he should appear in the House, he might not
make the same declaration there—a new reason for
alarming us that were averse to the motion. Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
Temple inquired after the result of the visit. Lord
Rockingham declared himself less satisfied than ever
with Mr. Pitt. Lord Temple assured him they were
as well disposed as ever to the Opposition; but then
dropped, that if the former designed arrangement
had taken place, he did not believe it would have
held six months. “Why?” said Lord Rockingham.
“Because,” replied Lord Temple remarkably, “I
believe the Duke of Devonshire, and others of you,
never liked that the Treasury should be put into <em>my</em>
hands.”</p>

<p>The Budget was opened by Grenville on the 29th
of March, an occasion that generally produces applause
to the Head of the Treasury, who must possess
more lights on that subject than other men;
and those lights strike the more forcibly, as the
audience are little masters of such intricate details;
and as the monied men, who alone feel the force or
deficiency of the Minister’s arguments, are rarely
endowed with eloquence, or even elocution. Yet
Grenville, who valued himself on his knowledge of
finance, and who, of all qualifications, wanted not
redundancy of words, spoke but languidly and unsatisfactorily,
chiefly pointing his very long speech
against a pamphlet published by Hartley, on the
State of the Nation. Himself, he said, would never
punish any invectives <em>against himself</em>; yet he betrayed
every symptom of soreness and malice. In
very few years afterwards he used the same means
with Hartley against the Administration; and, previous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
to a session of Parliament,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> published, or countenanced,
an invidious State of the Nation; but met
with a far more severe and able return than he himself
had made to Hartley.</p>

<p>On the 1st of April, the King withdrew to Richmond
for a week, but returned unexpectedly on the
3rd and 4th to his levee and drawing-room. This
sudden appearance was at that time supposed calculated
to prevent any notion of his being ill; and consequently
to avoid any proposal for a Bill of Regency,
in case he should fail. The Favourite, in the
meantime, began to give more open marks of his
disgust to the Ministers. A bill for regulating the
poor, drawn by one Gilbert,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> a member, and steward
to Lord Gower, had passed the Commons with
slight animadversion, and had been sent to the
Lords. The Earl of Egmont opposed it strenuously
on the first and second reading, and with much
applause; yet it was then carried. When it came
into the committee, Lord Bute’s friends exerted
themselves to throw it out; though, to disguise his
opposition, Lord Bute absented himself, and the
Earl of Northumberland voted for it; but as the
Favourite’s creatures, the Earls of Denbigh and
Pomfret, as well as Lord Egmont, conducted the
party against the bill, the Bedford party were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
the dupes of such flimsy arts. Lord Mansfield
faintly supported the bill; the Dukes of York and
Gloucester voted for it, yet the commitment was
rejected by 58 to 44, Newcastle, Lord Temple, and
the Opposition uniting against the Bedfords. Lord
Pomfret then moved to put off any farther consideration
of the bill for two months; but that measure
seeming too violent after it had passed one House,
and had been twice approved in the other, it was
carried by 50 to 49, to resume it after the holidays;
when the Bedfords consented to drop it.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>April the 3rd,—Sturt<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> and John Pitt<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> presented
to the Commons a petition from several merchants
complaining of encroachments by the French at
Newfoundland—another grievance that reflected on
the late peace. The Ministers had the assurance to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
oppose the reception of the petition, but managed
as awkwardly as indecently; and, at last, moved to
examine Commodore Palliser,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> who commanded on
the station in question. Palliser was a vigorous
officer and a sensible man, and had been so much
esteemed by Lord Anson, that Admiral Saunders,
desiring to have the assistance of Palliser, had offered
to relinquish the use of a 74-gun ship, if the Admiralty
would send Palliser with him. General Conway,
Colonel Barré, and Lord George Sackville
made severe remarks on the conduct of the Ministers.
Palliser was called for, but declaring he was
not prepared, the House allowed him time till the
next day.</p>

<p>When he appeared again, he produced a letter he
had sent to the French Commodore, at St. Pierre,
with remonstrances on their behaviour; and proved
that he had by no means connived at their innovations.
They had denied the justice of most of his
complaints; but to some had returned no answer.
Admiral Saunders, who spoke then for the first time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
and with extreme unreadiness, justified one of our
captains who had burned some French boats, and
said he would have done the same. Late at night
a sudden dispute arising whether Palliser should be
asked his opinion on an Act of Parliament relating
to the fisheries, the Ministers, who sought to evade
farther examination, opposed the question being put
to him. Some warm men in the Opposition supporting
that motion (though the wisest did not
concur with them), divided the House, to the great
joy of the Ministers, who rejected the question by
161 to 44: and thence, at once, determined to stifle
any farther inquiry, Rose Fuller moving to adjourn
the consideration for three months; and Nugent to
thank Palliser for his account of his own conduct,
though there were witnesses waiting to show it had
not been irreproachable. So eager were the pacific
Ministers to justify France, and wink at her encroachments.</p>

<p>Mr. Garth, the same day, presented a petition
from the agent for Virginia against the New American
Mutiny Bill, which ordered the billeting of
soldiers on private houses, as there were no inns in
that country; but this petition, too, the Ministers
refused to hear. In the debate, Grenville quoting
the Scotch law, young Thomas Townshend spoke
well and warmly against making the Scotch law
our precedent; and the younger Onslow said, that
three Scots were preferred for one Englishman.
Elliot spoke finely in answer; said he thought English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
and Scots were the same; and that if himself
had merit enough, he should pretend to any English
place. That partialities were always common;
had been shown to Sussex,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> and ought to be to
Buckinghamshire; and if the men of the latter
county<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> were the most worthy, he would support
them. The House then adjourned for the holidays,
when Grenville, finding the American merchants
vehemently averse to his new bill for billeting
soldiers in that country, promised to drop it.</p>

<p>When the Houses met again after the recess, a
very new scene opened to the public, though unfolded
by degrees, and of which all the springs
were not at first discovered. Accident, the rashness
of Opposition, and the intemperance of Ministers
concurred and wrought up the ensuing confusions;
but the source lay in the mutual jealousy
of the Favourite and Grenville, on which I have
already touched, and which terminated in lasting
mortification to the two rivals, and gave birth to
the various and fluctuating exhibition of politics
that took place and succeeded each other from this
period. In truth this was the era of faction, though
it did not immediately predominate. Hitherto it
might be said that the two parties of Whig and
Tory still subsisted; though Jacobitism, the concealed
mother of the latter, was extinct. The Court
had indeed admitted few Tories into place, from
their total want of abilities. But though Grenville
and the Duke of Bedford had always called themselves
Whigs, and the <em>Chancellor Northington really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
was one</em>, yet Lord Bute had left the standard of prerogative
in the Court, and his successors had relaxed
none of those high-flown doctrines. Nothing could
be more despotic than Grenville’s nature. Bedford
was drawn by the Duchess and Rigby to adopt any
principles, however contrary to his opinion, that
favoured her love of power, or Rigby’s rapacity: and
Lord Mansfield retained great weight in a cabinet
so framed to embrace boldly any arbitrary measures
that he was always ready to suggest and always
afraid to execute himself. On the other hand, the
Opposition, though headed by Newcastle, who had
sailed with every current, and though composed of
great and proud families, dated from the stand they
had made, or by resentment had been forced to
make, to the Favourite’s plan of extending the prerogative.
Lord Temple stood on no ground but
popularity; and the cast of Mr. Pitt’s life, contrary
to his temper, had thrown him too on the affections
of the people. The crisis I am going to describe
broke these ill-consolidated connections into several
factions; and though one of those factions adhered
more steadily to their professions than the rest, the
subsequent contests were rather a struggle for power,
than the settled animosity of two parties, though
the body of Opposition still called itself Whig, an
appellation rather dropped than disclaimed by the
Court; and though the real Tories still adhered to
their old distinctions, while they secretly favoured,
sometimes opposed, the Court, and fluctuated according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
as they esteemed particular chiefs not of
their connection, or had the more agreeable opportunity
of distressing those who supported the cause
of freedom. As their whole conduct was comprised
in silent votes, and never was considerable enough
to turn a single scale in the political changes,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> I
shall seldom mention them any more.</p>

<p>The King’s illness had occasioned a general alarm;
but, though he escaped the danger, his health was
so precarious, and he had such frequent disorders on
his breast on taking the least cold, that all sober
men wished to see a Regency settled by Parliament
in case of his death. Yet most of those who possessed
or hoped for power, dreaded such a bill: and
even they, who wished best to their country, could
not be without apprehension from it, as it would
probably be framed on the model of the last, which
contained the odious and arbitrary clause of præmunire,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
and as it would undoubtedly be calculated to
continue the domination of the Princess and the
Favourite, or of the Ministers then in place, an alternative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
equally threatening to liberty. The Princess
could by no means desire to hear a Regent nominated,
as she could not flatter herself she should be
the person in preference to the mother of the future
King. Should even a minority not happen, the
designation of the Queen for Regent would teach
mankind whither to address their homage, and draw
from the Princess that court which till now had been
paid to her as all-powerful over the mind of her son.
Lord Bute had brought himself into as disagreeable
a predicament. By having quitted his place in the
Cabinet, what pretensions could he have to one in
the Regency? Should he even obtain one by the
King’s recommendation or nomination, could he
hope for any influence under the Queen, to whom
the Council would bow? Could he promise himself
that the present Ministers would impart that power
to him under a Queen not likely to be his friend,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
from which they endeavoured to exclude him now,
though possessing the favour of the King? The Ministers
were still more jealous of any such bill. As,
according to the plan of the last, the great officers
in place at the time of the King’s death were to remain
of the Council of Regency, Grenville and his
adherents concluded that, to prevent such a contingency
in their favour, they should immediately be
removed. Accordingly those good men who preferred
any eventual confusion to the loss of their
places, set themselves roundly to work to prevent,
or if they could not prevent the proposal, to stir up
opposition from every quarter against such a regulation,
be it what it might.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these various obstacles, the necessity
of some provision surmounted all impediments;
and the very opposition made by the Ministers
did but serve to fix the irresolution of the Favourite.
I saw that this was the favourable moment
for bringing out the half-concealed, and, by
consequence, for producing a total, rupture between
Lord Bute and the Ministers. I early went to Lord
Holland, and asked him why they did not think
of a Regency-bill? He said he had pressed it on
Lord Bute and Lord Mansfield, but the latter was
too timid to propose it. That he himself had written
twice to Lord Bute on that subject, and had given
him leave to show his letters to the King, which he
believed he had <em>not</em> done: himself, however, should
not desist from pressing it, as he owned he believed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
the King in a consumption, and not likely to live a
year. We then talked over all the considerable
persons, and how their affections would probably lie
on such a question. Among others I named Lord
Granby, and said, he was wholly Grenville’s. “Yes,”
replied Lord Holland, “and should the King die,
might, if he had sense enough, be king himself;
and now,” said he, “you see the wisdom of not letting
any of the princes of the blood be at the head
of the Army.” I was not so dull as not to see deeper
into this hint. It informed me why Mr. Conway
had been removed out of the Army with so much
alacrity. It was a context to what Grenville himself
had dropped to me on that head, “<em>that the King
could not trust his Army in such hands</em>:”—that is, the
Court was determined to insure the Army for whatever
purposes they might have occasion to employ it
in. Another of Lord Bute’s creatures told me about
the same time that Grenville was grown too powerful
in the House of Commons. I own I did not think
the Constitution quite ruined, when the House of
Commons could make a Minister formidable to the
Crown. These and such like accidental passages
discover how deep the views of the Court had gone.
How happy for the nation that they who had laid
such plans were so unequal to the execution!</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, Lord Holland desired to
speak with me. He did not seem to have anything
particular to say, but rather to want to sound me on
the disposition of my friends in the Opposition; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
to learn if, in case of a rupture between Lord Bute
and Grenville, they would soften to the former. As
I thought any encouragement from the Opposition
would inspirit Lord Bute, and hasten his breach
with the Ministers, I instilled that assurance as
strongly as I could into Lord Holland, who said
Lord Bute complained that the Duke of Cumberland
and the Opposition were as acrimonious as ever.
This was true but in part, for the Duke had already
been gained to a certain degree by the King: and
as Lord Holland was very inquisitive to know from
me on what cause the Duke had been sent for to
the King, and had been shut up with him for two
hours on the foregoing Sunday, it was a proof that
Lord Bute had not that confidence in Lord Holland
which the world suspected. I did not then know
of that private interview of the King with the Duke.
Lord Holland said he guessed it was on the Regency-bill:
that he believed the Ministers had not
proposed such a bill to the King, but that his Majesty
had to them,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> and had ordered them to prepare
one. Lord Holland rejoiced at it,—for he feared
for the stocks. He repeated over and over that he
believed things would remain as they were; but
he dropped enough to convince me that that was
by no means the intention of Lord Bute. “Things,”
he said, “were not ripe yet; many things were
wanting: he lamented the death of the late Duke
of Devonshire, whose temper was not bitter, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
who could have done much: that Opposition resorted
to Mr. Pitt, who would have nothing to do with
them: that Grenville would be glad to be well
with Mr. Pitt, but that he, poor man, was ill in
bed.” This tenderness to one he hated so much,
was a clear indication that any assistance against
the Ministers would be welcome. I soon learned
how much farther these wishes had gone than I was
then apprized of. I told him he knew enough of the
Duke of Newcastle to be sure that the Court might
have him whenever they pleased; and as Newcastle
governed the Opposition, Lord Bute needed not
doubt their concurrence. Still Lord Holland had
the weakness to repeat that Lord Bute would be
nothing, and meant no change. To facilitate my
measures, I had it conveyed to the Bedfords, that
the Favourite lost ground; and that Lord Holland
was his instigator in promoting the bill,—an idea
which I soon found they eagerly adopted, and as
eagerly showed their resentment of on the first
opportunity.</p>

<p>I imparted to Lord John Cavendish the probability
of Mr. Pitt coming into place. He said,
“If that should be so, we could no longer oppose:
his family would take nothing, but the young Duke
would go to Court.” This I reported to Lord Holland:
he replied, To be sure, if there was any
change, the Duke of Devonshire must be at Court;
nor would the King scruple to say he had been in
the wrong in refusing to see the late Duke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
At length it was declared that a bill of Regency
was intended; but to the great dissatisfaction of mankind,
it was declared, too, that the nomination of the
Regent would be reserved by the bill in the King’s
breast. The crowd instantly conceived that this
was a mode of bestowing that important trust on
the Favourite; a chimera too wild and much too
dangerous to enter into so dastardly a nature as
Lord Bute’s. I have no doubt but there was an
uniform intention of appointing the Queen Regent;
though to save the dignity of the Princess, and to
keep up a dubious attention towards her, she might
have obtained this palliative, with the contingency
too, however improbable, of her outliving, and then
occupying the place of the Queen. The Ministers
rejoiced at these murmurs; and to pay their court
to the Queen, and to mortify the Princess and her
favourite, spared no pains to heighten this disgust,
which they even pretended to adopt; proceeding so
far as to make representations to the King against
his keeping the nomination secret. His Majesty
was obdurate. At last they obtained that the Regent
should be one of the Royal Family: a clear
indication of their affecting to suspect that he had
had thoughts of Lord Bute for that high office.
When this was conceded, and yet the Queen was
not named, it seemed to intimate that she was not
the person designed. Grenville and the Bedfords
were not men to offend by halves, or to halt when
they had gained ground. Pursuing their blow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
they told his Majesty, that the Queen not being
one of the Royal Family, if his Majesty had her in
contemplation, it would be requisite to specify her
by name. Even this point they carried at last. Yet
thus had every step of the former Regency-bill
furnished precedents for the most dangerous attempts.
A power had been granted to the late
King, of adding by his will four persons to the
Regent’s Council. As prerogative seldom adheres
to the strict letter of a precedent, but builds new
pretensions on the slightest foundation, the Crown
now, from four secret nominations, had jumped at
once to demand a secret nomination of the Regent.
Newcastle, one of the three authors<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> of the former
bill, was still alive to behold its copy, as was also
Fox, the opposer of it; but Newcastle now dreaded,
and Fox recommended the example!</p>

<p>The four secret nominations in the last bill of
Regency had arisen from the resentment of the
Dukes of Grafton<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> and Dorset,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> Lord Chamberlain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, that their
posts were not thought of importance enough to be
admitted into the Council of Regency. Yet Dorset
would not have profited of the new expedient. It
was thought that the four persons on whom the
late King had fixed, were the Duke of Grafton, the
then Duke of Devonshire, who had retired from
business, the Earl of Waldegrave, and Dr. Butler,
Bishop of Durham.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> On the majority of the successor,
it was supposed that the late King had
burned that designation; but his present Majesty
told Lord Mansfield that he had found the paper,
though he would not disclose who had been the
persons specified.</p>

<p>This measure of secret nominations was now revived—no
doubt with the view to the admission of
Lord Bute to the Council, which the opposition of
the Ministers and the temper of the times would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
openly allow at that moment. The jealousy occasioned
by this step was augmented by no mention
being made, in the first concoction of the bill, of his
Majesty’s brothers<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> and uncle.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> A plan which reserved
so much at the disposal of the secret Junto, and
which plan was not concerted <em>with</em>, but dictated by
the King <em>to</em> his Ministers, could not leave the latter
a moment’s doubt of their having lost their influence;
nor could fail to point out to them that that influence
was restored in its full force to the Favourite.
From that moment the Ministers assumed almost
the style, entirely the conduct, of Opposition; Rigby
scrupled not to say, that, if no opposition was made
to the bill, Lord Bute would grow intolerably insolent:
and the new Lord Waldegrave<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> said artfully
to an anti-courtier, “We cannot oppose this bill;
but why do not you?” This conduct of the Ministers
taught me my lesson. The more they laboured to
instigate our party to attack the bill, the more pains
I took to dissuade my friends from being warm
against it. For six months I had tried to raise
effectual war against Lord Bute and the Ministers.
The strength of their party when united, and the
weakness of ours, had baffled all my endeavours. The
happy moment was now come, when discord had declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
itself amongst them: and I was sure, whichever
division of them should remain in possession of
the closet, must court our assistance. I knew my
friends too well to think they were numerous or able
enough to form an Administration alone. Should
the King be reduced to admit them to a participation
of power, they had such good principles and
such fair characters that they would be a balance to
the rest, and might prevent many of the evil designs
in agitation. In my opinion I inclined most to Lord
Bute; for, though the mischief had sprung originally
from him, he had betrayed a pusillanimity that made
him far from formidable. Grenville and the Bedfords
had as bad principles, better heads, and far
more courage. I knew, too, that though my friends,
when joined to Lord Bute, might temporize, might
be corrupted, or might not be able to obstruct Lord
Bute’s views, Grenville and the Bedfords, if once
fixed in Opposition, would not be tame and impotent,
as we had been. No truth is more certain to me
than this; <em>though an Administration ought to be composed
of virtuous men, it is by no means desirable
that an Opposition should be so</em>. It is so seldom
that there are good measures to obstruct, that the
mischief done by opposition is small in proportion.
It must be remembered, too, that opposition obstructs
rather than prevents; and the difficulty on
opponents is the greater, if the measures are good;
salutary councils making their own way at last, after
fascination has vented its poison. But the bad measures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
of powerful men can only be combated with
efficacy by a determined party, equally able to expose
their evil tendency, and prompt to venture on any
arts to defeat them. Good men weep over their
country when they should defend it. Cassius killed
the tyrant; Cato, himself. If Lord Bute was again
to be Minister, I wished to see Grenville and Sandwich
patriots.</p>

<p>The Ministers having struggled in vain, and being
reduced at last to support what they could so ill
digest, the King, on the 24th of April, went to the
House of Lords, and sending for the Commons, recommended
to both Houses to provide a bill of Regency<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>
on the plan of the last, but with this singular
and material difference, that his Majesty demanded
to be invested with the power of appointing, from
time to time, by instruments in writing under his
sign manual, either the Queen, or any other person
of his Royal Family residing in Great Britain, to be
the guardian of his successor, and Regent of these
kingdoms, until such successor should attain the age
of eighteen years. Thus had the Junto flattered
themselves that the transient and loose mention of
the Queen’s name would stifle all murmurs, on the
supposition that even so vague a designation would
make men presume that no other person could be
preferred to her Majesty, after a specification that
marked her as proper for the trust.</p>

<p>Flattery, more nimble in venting itself than jealousy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
poured forth panegyrics on the magnanimity
of so young but provident a monarch. His grandfather
had dared to eye his own tomb; but could an
aged Prince, in conscience, leave his kingdoms and
family unprovided of a rule of government? How
far more heroic his present Majesty’s firmness, who,
in the vigour of youth, reflected on his own mortality,
and whose foresight provided against dangers which
his most loyal Peers and Commons prayed to Heaven
might never be <em>heaped on that bitterest distraction of
grief</em>, the loss of his Royal Person!<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> In the Upper
House the Address was moved by Lord Halifax. In
the other, Grenville was <em>not</em> so wrapt in admiration
and encomium, but he recollected himself enough
to open more of the contents of the bill than were
necessary to excite only loyal Hosannahs: and he
took care to declare that the measure had flowed
from his Majesty, not from the suggestion of his
Ministers. The path thus early chalked out to cavil,
Nicholson Calvert started some objections, though
he would not oppose the Address. Beckford went
farther, and said he would not vote for it, as it mentioned
the expedience of the bill, to which he did not
agree; and then talked much nonsense, of Parliament
being the guardians of a minor king. Calvert, who
was mad, was convinced by Beckford’s nonsense, and
their two were the only dissenting voices; George
Onslow having checked the debate by observing that
the bill was not yet before them. He, however, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
T. Townshend dropped some severe sentences. Grenville
and Lord North, who seconded him, were profuse
on the moderation of the King in accepting so
bounded a civil list, and in establishing the judges
for life—proof of dearth of topics for panegyric! I
have mentioned how trifling were the advantages
which the King had foregone in his revenue. By the
patents of the judges, not he, but his successor would
be limited. The same measure had been proposed
to the late King: he replied, he was content to
have no power of displacing the judges himself, but
he would not bind his heir.</p>

<p>The scope of the bill being now disclosed, it was
incumbent on our party to fix on the measures they
would pursue with regard to it. We had accordingly
a meeting of the chiefs, at the Duke of Newcastle’s,
on the 25th. I found the young men warm against
the bill, and full of the idea that it was solely calculated
to re-establish the empire of the Princess and
the Favourite. They neither knew, nor would listen,
to the state of factions in the Court. I told them they
were doing the business of the Ministers, who wished
for nothing so much as a vigorous opposition to the
bill. The only answer I could obtain was, they
should lose their characters if they did not oppose.
If they did oppose the bill, I thought nothing more
likely than that the Ministers should recover the
ground they had lost in the closet, by supporting
the very bill that they were instigating us to oppose.
Nay, in the warmth of debate, the passions of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
Ministers themselves might grow heated; and, as
men are always most angry with those from whom
they have received the latest offence, the Ministers, if
roughly attacked as the agents of Lord Bute, might
again become so; and he would certainly resent less
from those who should carry through his bill, than
from those whose enmity was inveterate and unalterable.
At best, Grenville and his faction would
have leisure to carry on the war against the Favourite,
while they saw him and the Opposition grow daily
more inveterate. My arguments were all in vain.
The <em>listlessness</em> of the party was now converted into
blind zeal: and a direct opportunity of reviling the
Princess and Lord Bute seemed already to those
warm young men a triumph over them. As we
parted, I told Lord John Cavendish that I thought
it much more for the interest of our country to
break the Ministry, than to oppose a single bill;
“but,” said I, “there is not a trap the Ministers set
for you, but what you fall into”—words that soon
proved to be prophetic.</p>

<p>On the 29th the King sent a message to the
Lords, desiring, instead of the four secret nominations,
to have his four brothers and his uncle<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> specified
in the bill; reserving only to himself the power
of filling up their places if they died. This step
seemed to exclude Lord Bute; but if ever he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
been designed to be admitted, this measure was only
a plausible evasion. Frederick, the youngest prince,
was in a deep consumption. The Duke of Cumberland’s
life was not less precarious; and without
any such contingency, a place in the Cabinet Council
would entitle the Favourite to one in the Regency.
The bill was then read for the first time.
It was followed by another bill sent from the other
House, and brought in there by Lord John Cavendish,
to oblige Peers and members of Parliament
to appear to suits, and to allow suits to proceed, if
such privileged persons refused to appear and make
answer. This was occasioned by the indecent refusal
of Lord Halifax to appear to Wilkes’s complaint.
The Ministers had suffered the bill to pass
the Commons, intending to have it rejected by the
Lords. The Peers had read it twice, and were now
going to commit it, when Lord Suffolk<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> moved to
have it put off for three weeks—Lord Weymouth
for two months, a method seldom used before the
Committee has attempted to correct a bill. Lord
Temple proposed to adjourn the consideration for a
week, that their minds might not be diverted from
the important consideration of the Regency-bill;
but Lord Suffolk’s motion was carried by 61 to 52,
though Lord Mansfield and Lord Bute voted <em>for</em>
the bill. This was a more explicit declaration of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
hostilities than the Favourite had yet attempted; at
least it was paying court to the Opposition, and canvassing
for their support to the Regency-bill. Still
so great was the confidence of the Ministers in their
own strength, or their want of judgment so capital,
that they lost the moment of ruining the Favourite,
and of establishing themselves at his expense. Had
they peremptorily refused to carry the Regency-bill
through, or had they resigned their places,
pleading their disapprobation of it, the whole odium
had fallen on Lord Bute; and as they would have
been joined by the Opposition in that clamour, the
Court must have yielded to any terms they had
thought fit to impose. Instead of such strenuous
conduct, they heaped nothing but disgrace and mortification
on their own heads. The Court obtained
its bill, however modified, but was equally offended
at the Ministers. The nation beheld them with
contempt, while they promoted obstruction to a bill,
which they confessed they disapproved, and yet submitted
to support. They flattered without humouring,
impeded without preventing, and offended without
hurting. This timid and double conduct they
changed into open treachery and provoking insolence,
when the moment was come in which they
ought to have studied nothing but reconciliation.</p>

<p>On the 30th, the bill was read for the second
time. Lord Lyttelton made a fine speech against
giving unconstitutional powers, such as that of appointing
an unknown person Regent. It was asking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
them, he said, to put out their own eyes. He hinted
a wish of having the Queen named, and was going to
make a proposal tending that way, but was stopped
by Lord Halifax, for no better reason than that
her Majesty might not always be a proper Regent,
though she was so then. The Duke of Newcastle
having been so deep in the fabrication of the former
bill, dared not object to anything similar in the present,
and therefore said he had no objection but to
the reserve of specifying the Regent, a power that
ought not to be entrusted to any King. The Chancellor,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>
in his rough style, treated the Duke and the
former bill with contempt and acrimony. The last
bill, though drawn by all-wise, all-patriotic Ministers,
had been, he said, most imperfect. This would
correct it. Lord Lyttelton had ascribed the last bill
to the late Earl of Hardwicke,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> whom the Chancellor
ridiculed, and said it had been calculated for his own
power, and that of Newcastle and Pelham: and he
asked bluntly why they had not substituted in that
bill the Duke of Cumberland in case the Princess
had died? That they were guilty, if the faults of
the bill had been owing to craft. The Princess had
been at that time so long resident in England, that
it was reasonable to appoint her Regent. The youth
of the Queen and her little acquaintance with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
country rendered her less proper. Would their
Lordships wish to place her Majesty in so invidious
a situation, and wrest her out of her subjection to
the King? Who would wish to have his own wife
so independent? Would they determine that the
same person should be Regent for seventeen years,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>
to whom they would entrust such power for three
years? The Duke of Newcastle replied, that the
age of the present King had been so far advanced
as had made no substitution of Regents necessary.
He had never known till within a few days, that in
the eye of the law the Queen is not of the Royal
Family. Lord Shelburne said the Constitution was
secure in itself, and knew no minority. Parliament
supplied all deficiencies. His objection was not to
parts, but to the whole bill. Lord Sandwich said he
was informed that our laws made no provision for
a minority, but that whoever got possession of the
infant King’s person, was King. In that case military
force would be most likely to govern. The
next thing he should dread would be a democracy:
a popular orator,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> backed by turbulent magistrates,
might seize the government. Lord Temple said
he appealed from Cæsar ill-advised to Cæsar well-advised;
<em>was himself of no party, nor connected with
any party</em>; was, and had been, against all Regency-bills.
Lord Mansfield answered, that the King had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
heard so much of regencies formerly, that of this bill
he had thought himself. If their Lordships did not
think a bill of Regency necessary, his Majesty was
under a mistake: but he feared they were sowing
the dragon’s teeth. By the ancient Constitution the
Parliament was dissolved at the King’s death. The
Queen or great men secured a majority, and then
called a Parliament to confirm their power. Bills of
indemnity, restitution, and regency flowed properly
from the Crown itself. Regency was a trust, not
power. What would be good for his Majesty’s children,
would be good for his people. At least there
would be a foundation for Government to set out
upon: unless it was thought that deliberation would
be wiser, when men should be heated by the crisis,
than now, when they could coolly provide against a
distant period. The Parliament had not acted so
negligently in Queen Anne’s reign, but settled a
regency, and got stability before the event happened.
Last time it had been considered whether it were
not wise to make a perpetual act; but it was answered
that the bill, then passed, would be a precedent,
and change of circumstances might not make
exactly the same provisions always proper. Lord
Temple shrewdly, and bitterly, with allusion to Lord
Mansfield’s friends, family, and supposed principles,
asked him, Supposing the Parliament had left to
Queen Anne the secret nomination of her successor,
whom his Lordship thought she would have appointed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
Between six and seven the House divided, 120
for the bill, and only 9 against it, Newcastle
and his whole party retiring, either from shame
of contradicting their former conduct, or not being
determined to give openly the offence which they
had sounded so high in private; or that Newcastle
was biassed by the Duke of Cumberland, whom
the King had consulted secretly, both on the bill
and on the subsequent measures which he wished
to pursue. Thus Lord Temple, with his small
faction, and one or two of Mr. Pitt’s friends, was
deserted, after the most sanguine expectations of
a vigorous opposition. He resented this desertion
with his usual <em>intemperance</em>; yet what claim had he
on the concurrence of those with whom he had sedulously
declined all connexion? His resentment on
this occasion was, I do not doubt, a leading step to
a new alliance into which he soon after hurried.
His companions in the vote I have mentioned were
the Dukes of Grafton and Bolton, the Earls of Shelburne,
Thanet, Ferrers, and Cornwallis, the Viscount
Torrington, and Lord Fortescue. The Duke of Grafton’s<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>
vote thus early pointed out that he looked
more towards Lord Chatham than to Newcastle.
Lord Lyttelton, more temperate than his cousin
Temple, had withdrawn with Newcastle and the
others to avoid voting, the Chancellor having forced
a division by declaring the <em>non-contents had it</em>.
Lord Lyttelton then read his motion to address the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
King, to name the person or persons whom his Majesty
would successively recommend for Regents, as
there was no precedent of <em>devising</em> regal power. The
Duke of Bedford moved to adjourn the motion till
the next day, for which he was grossly abused by
the Chancellor, who was averse to all admission of
the motion.</p>

<p>On the morrow Lord Lyttelton made his motion
accordingly, urging that the Crown cannot devolve
its power on unknown persons. Was it prudent to
give the King absolute power, on the presumption
that he would do nothing but for the good of his
successor? Lord Mansfield replied, that giving such
power was not <em>contrary</em> to precedent, though <em>not
founded</em> on precedent. The usage and precedent of
Parliament formerly had been to make no precedent
at all. If all the persons substituted should fail, it
would be necessary to frame a new bill. It was
wise not to let the person designed for Regent be
acquainted with that designation. The longer time
the King should have to determine on the choice of
the person, the better that election would be. The
Duke of Richmond,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> though declaring he disapproved
of Lord Lyttelton’s motion, said he wished to know
<em>who the Royal Family were</em>? He wished to have
it defined, or to learn from the judges. Was the
Princess Dowager of the Royal Family? Were the
Princess Amalie, and the Princess of Hesse<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
children? Were the hereditary Prince<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> and the
King of Prussia?<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> The hereditary Prince had been
naturalized: might he, if resident in England, be
Regent? How long time constitutes residence? He
should not like the Prince for Regent, though it was
indifferent to him who was so, for he hoped the laws
were sufficient. By the Act of Settlement her Majesty
could not be Regent: nor could she, though
naturalized; for an act of naturalization must have a
disqualifying clause, or is invalid. Had her Majesty
been naturalized? His Grace declared himself of
no opposition; that he hated and had always opposed
opposition. Lord Denbigh pronounced that all who
are prayed for by the Common Prayer-book are of
the Royal Family. Would it be prudent, he asked,
to put a question to the judges before the bill was
framed? By her marriage, he thought the Queen
was naturalized of course. Lord Pomfret with great
violence opposed the motion, but was called to order
by Lord Lyttelton for having quoted the speeches
and vote of the preceding day, the latter declaring
that he acted from conscience, not by concert. The
Duke of Grafton professed great gratitude to the
King for the bill; though, when framed, it must be
considered as the act of the Ministers; and that, unless
it was perfect, it were better to have no bill. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
could not please the people, for everything was left
in doubt. It took from the King the joy of seeing
the whole nation pleased with the nomination of
her Majesty. Would not this be casting a slur on
her? Though built on the last bill, the present,
with regard to her, widely differed. On the sixteenth
of the month the Queen would be twenty-one.
The delay of a single fortnight would have seen her
of age. The bill was precipitated now after it had
been declared that all business was over. Lord
Mansfield said, mysteriously, that he had his private
opinion on who are of the Royal Family; but he
should not declare it. (He and the Chancellor had
both told the King that neither the Queen nor the
Princess Dowager were of the Royal Family.) Lord
Talbot, who had opposed the bill of the last reign,
said he had liked on the preceding day to see certain
Lords (Newcastle, &amp;c.) in the majority, when they
did not direct the majority. He hoped this motion
would not be mentioned out of the House, lest it
should get into seditious papers. He thought the
present bill left too little power to the Regent: it
must be the Queen. He understood the Royal
Family to be the Queen, the Princess Dowager, the
royal dukes, and the Princess Amalie. Lord Shelburne
spoke well for decision and precision. It is
urged, said he, that the King can have no views:
what views could Parliament have, but the security
of liberty and property? The Duke of Bedford said
it was great condescension in the King to limit the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
Council of Regency to a certain number: but the Act
ought not to be irrevocable for sixteen years together.
He looked <em>on the Royal Family to be those who
are in the order of succession one after another</em>, and
usually resident here in England. (This definition
was evidently laid down to exclude the Princess Dowager.)
The Administration had no merit or demerit
by this act; it was purely the deed of his Majesty.
Lord Egmont<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> said it must be more agreeable to the
Queen to be named Regent by the King than by
Parliament (a poor argument, as the recommendation
of the King must have been more agreeable to
her than silence out of respect to his mother). The
Opposition supposed possible infirmities in his Majesty:
could there be none in the Queen? More
respect had been shown to her than to him. Lord
Dartmouth summed up very ably all the arguments
of the courtiers; and concluded with observing in
answer, that some few would certainly know whom
the King destined for Regent, and might form their
intrigues accordingly. The motion had indeed taken
its rise from the Crown, but he supposed his Majesty
had taken advice on the mode.</p>

<p>The House then divided, and Lord Lyttelton’s motion
was rejected by 89 to 31; Newcastle and his
friends, and the Bishops attached to him, chiefly forming
the minority: Lord Temple sullenly staid away.</p>

<p>But while the debate had been going on, an event
happened which gave birth to all that followed. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
Duke of Richmond had drawn up a question which
he intended to put to the judges, to ascertain who
were persons of the Royal Family. He had stated
the Princes and Princesses in their order of succession.
I happened to be standing on the steps of
the throne: the Duke showed me the sketch of his
motion. I observed that he had omitted the Princess
Dowager; and instantly reflecting, from the behaviour
of the Ministers, and from what has just dropped
from the Duke of Bedford, that they wished to exclude
her from the possibility of being Regent; and
concluding, too, that if she was stated as one of the
Royal Family, they would be rash enough to oppose
it, I said, “My Lord, your Grace is not in Opposition,
and do not mean any offence by this motion: why
then do not you insert the name of the Princess? By
omitting her she will think you purposely intend to
affront her.” The Duke was struck with my advice
and inserted the Princess’s name. The Ministers,
more violent and insolent than even I had expected
them to be, plunged headlong into the snare I had
laid for them; and as will soon be seen, wantonly,
cruelly, and treacherously, gave such provocation,
both to the King and Princess, as scarce the most
intemperate Opposition could have been guilty of.</p>

<p>The Duke of Richmond then read to the House
his intended motion,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> and proposed that the judges
should be ordered to attend on the morrow. Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
Mansfield said it would be better to correct the
words of the bill: the judges could not be consulted
till some words were settled. He would not point
out any words, lest he should pledge his opinion for
the passing them. The Duke of Richmond replied,
the words had been proposed by the King—and was
going to proceed; but Lord Sandwich, already
alarmed at the name of the Princess, suddenly moved
the House to adjourn.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of May the Duke made his motion.
The Chancellor said, he had been too much fatigued
to answer his Grace the day before. The question
was now, whether the Queen could be naturalized?
Himself would be for rejecting the bill if her Majesty
could not be Regent. He thought she was naturalized
by her marriage, and incorporated one of the
Royal Family, the Christian religion having been
adopted into the common law. By a law of Edward
III. all the King’s children are naturalized whereever
born. That her Majesty was not disabled by
the acts of William III., or George I. If she was
not effectually naturalized, she had got a bad settlement
for her jointure. The clause in the Act of Settlement
was futile, for one Parliament cannot bind a
succeeding one. However, if any doubt remained,
he hoped his opinion would not be conclusive,
but that the judges would be consulted. He could
not tell who were of the Royal Family; but he
knew who were not—the Pretender and his sons.
He desired to have the Princess understood to be of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
the Royal Family. The other branches, while they
have an establishment abroad, were not within the
present Act. If the hereditary Prince should die, and
his Princess come over, she would be within the Act.
The Duke of Richmond replied, that if there was
nothing positive in the common law to show the
Queen was <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ipso facto</i> naturalized, there was in the
statute law to prove the contrary: and therefore
asked, if part of the clause in the Act of George I.
must not be repealed? That clause declaring, that
no person naturalized could hold land or office, and
enjoining that they should not be naturalized without
such a clause. Many doubts, he said, had already
been expressed in the House, whether the Princess
was of the Royal Family: without doors there were
still more doubts. He had been stopped the day before
by a trick of adjournment. Lord Mansfield had
owned he had an opinion, but would not declare it:
it was therefore the more necessary to have that
uncertainty cleared away, for which end he had a
motion ready drawn in his hand.</p>

<p>The House then resolving itself into a committee,
the Duke proposed to state his amendment, unless
their Lordships would consult the judges. The Chancellor
said, it would be improper to ask the judges
who are of the Royal Family, but not whether the
Queen was naturalized. The judges could only
interpret laws passed. Lord Halifax pretending to
plead against delay, laboured to prevent the Duke
from stating any question that might declare the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
Princess of the Royal Family; but Richmond, with
inimitable firmness and address, maintained his
ground, and moved to insert the words <em>Her Royal
Highness the Princess Dowager and others descended
from the late King, now resident in England</em>; though
Lord Halifax had tried to substitute a distinction
between a Royal Family of <em>consanguinity</em>, and a Royal
Family of affinity. After a long squabble the Duke’s
motion was rejected, and the ministerial party having
allowed that the judges might be consulted on the
Queen’s naturalization, Lord Folkestone moved to
put the question to them on the morrow. Lord
Mansfield, from fear of being pressed to give the
answer he had given to the King, or to change it, or
from some apprehension equally unworthy of his situation,
absented himself. The Chancellor appeared
there, as has been seen, and contradicted himself.</p>

<p>On the 3rd the Judges, by the mouth of the Lord
Chief Justice Pratt, declared that the Queen was
naturalized by her marriage, and capable of being
Regent; but how great was the astonishment of mankind
at what followed! Lord Halifax, hastening
impetuously into the House, went up to the Duke of
Richmond, and asked if his Grace was satisfied? The
Duke replied, “By no means: you have rejected my
motion and left my doubt in full force.” “Then, my
Lord,” said Lord Halifax, “if you will move it again,
I will satisfy you”—and standing up in his place, he
delivered an intimation (not a message) that it would
be agreeable to his Majesty to have the bill recommitted;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
which being complied with, Lord Halifax,
on the same mysterious authority, proposed to insert
the motion of the Duke of Richmond, rejected the
day before, specifying the several persons of the
Royal Family, <em>only omitting the Princess Dowager</em>.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>
This wonderful proposal took place instantaneously;
and, it being early in the day, several Lords and others,
whose curiosity was carrying them to see the conclusion
of so interesting a scene, met the Ministers
returning from the House with exultation at their
success; and could scarce believe, and less comprehend,
the meaning of so daring and improbable an
enterprize.</p>

<p>Daring in truth it was, and perhaps not to be paralleled.
The fact happened thus:—Lord Halifax<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>
and Lord Sandwich (the latter of whom had probably
machinated so treacherous a step) had posted to
Buckingham House a little hour before the Lords
assembled, and surprising the King alone, had most
falsely, and contrary to all likelihood, assured him,
that the House of Commons would certainly strike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
the name of the Princess Dowager out of the bill;
and therefore that the most decent and prudent
method to save the honour of his Majesty and her
Royal Highness would be, for his Majesty to permit
it to be hinted to the Lords, that he himself desired
their Lordships would omit his mother’s name, before
they transmitted the bill to the Commons. The
young inexperienced monarch, taken by surprise,
alarmed at the insult announced, and not having
time, or not having presence of mind to demand time
for consulting his mother and his Favourite, answered
with good-nature, <em>that he would consent if it would
satisfy his people</em>. The traitors seized that assent,
and, hurrying away with double rapidity to the House
of Lords, procured in the very name of their master
that indelible stigma on his own mother!</p>

<p>Intoxicated as they were with presumption, or
blind with the thirst of revenge, still it is hard to
conceive how the Ministers dared to venture on so
provoking and desperate an insult. Could the King
pardon such an insult on his understanding, or the
Princess submit to such an affront to her dignity and
character? Could the Crown retain a shadow of
power without discarding such servants? Could the
wildness of Opposition have imagined such an act of
aspersion, or have found a sufficient number so destitute
of hopes and of flattery, as to fix a stain on the
whole royal blood? That Sandwich should have
conceived a plot so base, especially when surprise and
stratagem were to be the ingredients, was not marvellous:
that Grenville should have embraced it, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
lost all sight of ambition in the glut of his revenge,
proved what dominion every bad passion had over
him in its turn; that the Duke of Bedford should
have closed with it, was but another instance of the
empire his associates had over a mind naturally good—that
none of the connexion, composed of men devoted
to fortune, should have started at a proposition
so big with ruin to their hopes of favour, evinced
that when they had lost sight of honesty and decorum,
they flattered themselves that no position could be
so desperate, from which they might not recover by
as bad arts as those which brought them into the
dilemma. Their subsequent conduct showed that
they were determined to storm the Cabinet they
could not retain by address.</p>

<p>It is not less worthy of remark that this bill, so
carefully planned to save the honour or humour of
the Princess, became the instrument of loading her
with disgrace; while the Duke of Cumberland and
the King’s brothers, who had been sedulously passed
over in silence, saw themselves reinstated in the
very bill from which the Princess was alone excluded:
the Queen, who had been sacrificed to the jealousy
of her mother-in-law, was the sole person that reaped
both honour and a certain view of power from
an act in which she had been so little respected.
The Duke of Bedford and Lord Sandwich were overturned
by this, as they had been by the last bill of
Regency in the preceding reign.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center b2">Debates in the House of Commons on the Regency Bill.</p></blockquote>

<p>The bill thus wonderfully modified was sent to the
House of Commons, where it was read the first time
without a word of animadversion or notice. In fact,
the extraordinary step taken by the Ministers had
occasioned such consternation, that no man was ready
to decide what part he would take. As my views
had been so fully answered by the hostilities into
which I had drawn the Ministers against the Court,
I wished my friends to lie by, and wait the event of
that quarrel. The Duke of Cumberland, who had
been secretly applied to by the King for his protection
against the Ministers, and who was content with
seeing the Princess thus publicly branded, and consequently
divested of all hope of being Regent, was
desirous, too, that the Opposition should give no
farther impediment to the bill. By his direction
Lord Albemarle prevailed on his brother, Admiral
Keppel, on Admiral Saunders, General Honeywood,
and others of the military, to declare they were
satisfied and would go no farther. But there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
a head so incomparably wrong and obstinate, that
no discretion, no address, no salutary counsel, could
regulate or restrain its determinations. This was
Lord John Cavendish, the most conceited and self-willed
young man I ever knew, and whose love of
rule would listen to no advice that crossed his
own ideas. He insisted on making Lord Lyttelton’s
motion for naming the Queen Regent, and
intended to move it at the first reading of the bill.
Mr. Conway no sooner came into the House, than
Lord John took him aside to persuade him to concur
in that measure. I observed this, and followed them.
Fitzroy<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> and Honeywood joined us, and declared
against it. Mr. Conway was staggered, and advised
deferring the motion till the day of the commitment.
We agreed to meet at night at Sir George Saville’s;
but I would not go, being determined not
to act with them in such ill-timed hostilities, and
knowing I should have more weight with Conway in
a private conversation, than in a tumultuous debate;
but I prepared Fitzroy, and sent him warm to the
meeting: having hinted to him that I could see no
reason why the Duke of Devonshire’s youngest brother
should govern the Duke of Grafton’s brother.
Fitzroy went and repeated the opinion of the officers
against the motion. Lord John said, rudely, it was
to save their commissions. Mr. Conway yielded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
and the motion was resolved on. Yet, Lord John’s
brothers, George and Frederick, and Admiral Keppel,
all repeated their opinion to me, and complained
of Lord John’s warmth. Lord Rockingham, though
much swayed by Lord John, I shook; then went
to Mr. Conway, where I found the last. He was
more obstinate than ever, and said he wished the
Opposition was reduced to six or seven, who could
depend on one another. I smiled and said, “I was
too old to wait on his Lordship to Utica.”</p>

<p>May 7th. The bill was read a second time, and
Lord John made his motion to address the King,
to name the Regent;<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> but it was so thinly and
feebly supported, that they could not divide for it.
De Grey, the Solicitor-General, was so good a courtier,
that on <em>this emanation of the King’s mind</em>, as he
called it, he declared he would be against the bill,
if the Regent was named. T. Townshend observed
that the nomination was to be testamentary, and
yet no witnesses to it. That though a living king
might be complimented with the attributes of divinity,
everybody knew how little respect was paid
to a dead king; and then, laughing at De Grey,
he said, “If in these times of <em>no Cabal, no ambition</em>,
(the Solicitor’s words,) we could settle no provision,
would it be more possible in future? or would the
House imitate the Parliaments of Henry VIII.,
which gave him power both over religion and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
succession? George Grenville expressed respect to
Lord John, but asked how any man who was against
the whole bill, could approve of that motion? was
this an unlimited power? The King could name
a very small number as the bill now stood. This
bill had been framed after those drawn by Lord
Somers and Lord Hardwicke. The testamentary
instruments were to be sealed by three great officers,
and much form to be used in recalling them.
Would you address the King to name all the future
substitutions that he might make? There was no
precedent, it was said, of such a bill—was there any
of such an address? The motion went to an unrestrained
nomination. Should the King name, would
the House not confirm it?—and then what a precedent
would there be! Lord John Cavendish replied,
that he was not against the whole bill, though he
disapproved many of the clauses. Yet they who disliked
the whole would be consistent, as they might
desire to make it as perfect as might be, though
they could not obtain all they wished. At present,
the King might revoke his nomination, and yet omit
to substitute another person. For himself, he still
disliked any secret nomination. T. Townshend, too,
said, that if the address was carried, the House would
not be tied down to approve any improper person.
Onslow went farther, and said, that in a vacancy the
throne was elective. Charles Yorke, that if the
King was out of the kingdom, his power was defective.
A general bill for all times could not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
framed. The judges thought that the grandchildren
of the Crown were not the children of the Crown.
Yet all the King’s family should look up to the
King, and ought not to be made independent of
him. Colonel Onslow said, he would appoint the
people father of the child, till the child could be the
father of them. Mawbey offered to second any man
who would expressly name the Queen; but that proposal
and the motion for the address were almost
unanimously rejected. James Grenville then objected
to the commitment of the whole bill, though
he was not against all Regencies, but had heard none
such as he should like described. Colonel Barré was
for a Regency, but saw no precision in the proposed
bill. Should there be no bill, what power could
punish a bold man that should engross the government?
The house would punish <em>him</em> who was as
bold and daring as any man. (This seemed meant
at Lord Bute, though much more true of Grenville.)
He was against the King’s power, of naming the Regent.
It was a bad measure, having so many capital
figures in it. He was an enemy to adulation, but
must ask, if men, who would give up their rights
under a good prince, were likely to reclaim them
under a bad one? If the Queen was intended for
Regent, let the House meet the wishes of their Sovereign
and name her. If her Majesty was ambitious,
she might have availed herself of this bill. Yet he
believed she had both art and ambition, but had
used them for no end but to make her consort adored.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
Was that a reason for excluding her? This bill had
no stamp of royalty in it. All the King’s acts had
tended to decrease his prerogative. This was a ministerial
bill. Nor Somers nor Hardwicke had proposed
a secret nomination. Cardinal Beaton had
read a paper to his dying master, and passed it off
for the King’s act: such an artifice might be repeated.
In the Council of Regency the Princes might outvote
the Queen. Should the Queen die in three or four
years, was the King’s nomination to take place of
the wisdom of Parliament then sitting? He declared
that in his military capacity he would serve with
fidelity, but in the House would oppose what he
held was not for the King’s good. Norton, the
Attorney-General, declared that the Parliament appointed
to sit for six months after the King’s death
might sit, or not, at the option of the Crown. Wedderburn,
boasting that he dated his principles from
the Revolution, said he approved the bill, because
copied from those times. They had delegated power
to unknown persons by establishing a Regency of
such as should be in possession of the great offices at
the death of Queen Anne. General Conway approved
of sending the bill to the committee out of respect,
and in order to try to amend it; but thought the
power to be granted worse than the want of provision.
It was not unconstitutional to make provision
against accidents, but it was so to make bad provision.
The King would now be empowered to name
for the whole sixteen years that his son might be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
minor. For the House of Lords, he said, they had
deliberated without concluding, and then concluded
without deliberating. Grenville said, that not going
into the committee would be putting an end to all
bills of Regency. If the difference of opinion was so
great already, what would it be on the King’s death,
if no provision were made? It was unconstitutional
to say that King, Lords, and Commons could not
repeal any act. Had not they repealed two-thirds
of Magna Charta, particularly in the case of wards
and liveries? For himself, he dreaded some great
military man (the Duke of Cumberland), and thought
he already heard the lion roar. Onslow replied, that
a Secretary of State, ready with head and hand to
execute General Warrants, was more formidable
than a King, who was popular by deserving to be
so. The bill was committed, and the House rose
at nine o’clock without a division.</p>

<p>I went the next day to the Duke of Newcastle; he
saluted me with saying how much he was against my
opinion of absenting ourselves from the House
(which I had proposed the day before, when I found
I could not restrain our party otherwise). It would
ruin our characters, he said, to keep away;—(I could
scarce refrain from laughing at hearing <em>him</em> talk of
<em>character</em>)—and that if we did not oppose in the
House of Commons, the Duke of Bedford would not
in the House of Lords—(this was founded on the
report of Morton intending to move for reinstating
the name of the Princess). “And do you think, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
Lord,” replied I, “that the Duke of Bedford will oppose
if we do? I know he will not; and I will tell
your grace what will happen; the very reverse of
what you expect. Instead of being against the
Princess, you will be included in a vote for her.
No mortal will speak against her: if nobody does, there
will be no division, and thus you will vote for her.”
He was struck, and said he was sorry, but the young
men would have it so. I said, “My Lord, why do not
you govern your young people, and not let them
govern you?” He replied: “They all say they will
be governed by me sooner than by anybody, except
where their conscience directs;” however, he would
go and talk it over with Lord Rockingham. I then
went to Mr. Conway and told him what had passed.
I said “I saw we were all to be governed by a raw
obstinate vain boy; that I found I had no weight;
and though I would vote with them once more, if
we were drawn into a division on the Princess, that
they might not say I deserted them from interested
views, yet it should be the last time; and I would
go to the House no more. That he gave up his
opinion to Lord John, though he would not to me;
and that if Lord John did but whistle the words
<em>honour</em> and <em>virtue</em>, he could turn him (Conway) which
way he pleased.” Mr. Conway complained of my
warmth, and said Lord John had given up the question
on the army at our desire, (which was true,) that
for his part he desired no place, and liked very well
to act with a few. “And how long,” said I, “do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
think they will let a few only act? What are we
doing? or why? is it not for our country? If we
can serve it better by silence than by speaking, is not
it preferable?” He said he preferred his character
and the Cavendishes to his country. “Then,” said I,
“I would never have embarked with any of you,
had I known you only acted for the applause of the
mob.” However, I made no impression on him but
by one argument; and by that not enough. I said,
“If you force a division against the Princess, you will
have very few with you. Those few will hate you
for it. Most of your friends will leave you, as they
did last night, by which you discovered to the
Ministers your weakness, and the divisions in your
party. If you force most of your friends to abandon
you, as most men will, by so ungentleman-like, outrageous,
provoking, and unjustifiable an act, as stigmatizing
the King’s mother, for which you cannot
give a plausible, and dare not give the true reason,—(for
will any of you venture to allege what none of
you can prove, her intrigue with Lord Bute?)—you
demolish the party at once. Those of you who shall
vote against the Princess will abuse those who vote
for her, as influenced by mercenary views; and thus,
when you have once made them desperate, and shall
have forced them to have merit with her, they will
of course adhere to her whom they have been courting.
I have divided the Ministry by suggesting to
the Duke of Richmond to name the Princess: you
are going to give the Ministers an opportunity of recovering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
the ground they have lost, by defending her
against you.” “Why,” said Mr. Conway, “if the Ministers
should break, to which division would you go?”
“Certainly,” said I, “to Lord Bute and Mr. Pitt, rather
than to the Bedfords.” He declared he should prefer
the latter. In short, we did not agree at all; though
he said all he could to soften me, and expressed the
greatest concern at differing with me: but it was so
material not to suffer Lord John’s inexperience and
folly to govern the party, that I determined to make
my stand there; for I saw that young man’s rashness
was capable of over-turning in an instant all I had
been planning for six months. I first had tried to
form a party to overthrow the Administration, Bute,
Grenville, Bedfords, and all. When I found the
Opposition too weak and too foolish to compass
that, I turned to the next best thing, dividing Bute
and the Ministers. In that I succeeded; and then
saw all my schemes and labours on the point of being
blasted by a silly boy, who, when all I had foreseen
happened, had not a word to say for himself. Thus
did I perceive <em>how vexatious it was to live with many
fools and not with enough</em>! I did not forget the lesson:
it took deep root, and was the first inducement
to me to form a resolution of quitting politics.
Other events contributed; and I was wise enough
not to throw away those fruits of my experience.
Yet, before I quitted the scene, I had the pleasure
of accomplishing all the views that first set me in
motion, of demolishing a dangerous Administration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
of humbling Grenville and the Bedfords, and of convincing
Lord John Cavendish, that it had been more
prudent not to provoke me by attempting to interfere
with my influence with Mr. Conway. With
regard to the Duke of Newcastle, whom I had
always despised, and with whom a common cause
had obliged me to act, I did find how well-grounded
my contempt of him had been, and to how little
purpose it was to act with him. He was always
eager, but never ready: delighted in talking over
measures, but knew not how to begin or pursue
them; and was as happy in seeming to lead an
ineffectual party, as he had been in governing the
nation. He thought he possessed secrets if he did
but whisper, or was whispered to. Attendance on
him was his supreme joy; and if two of the party
came to him on the same business, he made one
of them wait, to wear an air of mystery to both.
There never was a man who loved power so much,
and who could enjoy the shadow with the same
content, when the substance was gone. Nor is it
less remarkable, that, though favour at Court was
the object of his life, he began it with insulting the
Prince of Wales (George II.), and concluded it
with affronting the Princess Dowager.</p>

<p class="hang50 b2">Debates on the Regency-bill.—The Princess Dowager’s name reinserted
in the Bill.—Bill for altering the Duties on Italian Silks.—Riots
of the Weavers on its introduction.—Projected change
in the Ministry.</p></blockquote>

<p>On May the 9th, the House went into committee
on the bill. Rose Fuller said he would not opiniate
the point, but declared he was against the precedent
of appointing an unknown person Regent; not against
any of the persons that had been named as qualified:
yet surely none of them were so proper as the Queen.
Should a younger brother be appointed by his Majesty’s
will, it would offend the elder. So had the
Parliament thought in the minority of Henry VI.,
with regard to the Dukes of Bedford and Gloucester.
It was the more necessary to name the Queen, as he
had heard of another motion going to be made.
Everybody, therefore, would understand the reason
of his motion. He moved, accordingly, to insert the
name of the Queen, instead of the words <em>such persons</em>;
and was seconded by Mr. Onslow, and by Sir
W. Meredith, who declared he had intended to make
the same motion. It was objected to by Burrell,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
who said, the Duke of Cumberland’s name had not
stood in the original bill; had been inserted on
after-thought; would the House omit him now?
Lord George Sackville said, he had been against even
the respectful manner in which Lord John Cavendish
had proposed to address the King to name the
person he should wish for Regent: he was much
more against the present motion. In history there
was no precedent worth following. His Majesty
was tied by parental affection to name the Queen,
and was best qualified to know his own family, and
who would be most proper for the office. If his
youngest brother was best qualified, let him be
named. Let the whole family be taught to pay
their court to and imitate the King. Conway
replied, that the power now to be given was a compliment
to all future kings. Would Parliament be
able to say, We trusted this power to George III. for
his virtues, and refuse it to any other king, though
vicious. The young Princes of the blood might prove
ambitious. The bill itself would be of no force if
the King should leave the nomination not filled up.
No provision was made against such a contingency.
When the late King went abroad, he always left a
private letter empowering the Lords of the Regency
to fill up places. In that reign though the Duke of
Cumberland was so proper for Regent, yet his present
Majesty’s mother had been preferred—let the House<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
therefore imitate that sole precedent. Dempster opposed
the motion, yet with passing general censures.
He did not approve, he said, all the Ministers had
done, particularly the dismission of General Conway.
He did not approve the oriental adulation heaped on
the birth of this bill; he saw nothing so heroic in it.
He did not approve the power entrusted to the Regency
of continuing the Parliament for three years.
Lord North urged that the motion was unnecessary,
because everybody knew there would be no person
named against whom the House could have any objection.
Sir George Saville said, he was astonished
to hear that uncertainty was the parent of security,
and certainty of uproar and confusion. He was afraid
of delegating new powers; he rejected all arguments
founded on personal considerations. He felt them
as strongly as anybody, but they were false, unlogical,
and unfair. All the persons declared capable, were
proper; but while there was one more proper, the
rest were improper. Lord Frederick Campbell said,
the motion tended to appoint a person with greater
power than the King’s. Dowdeswell replied, that the
powers given by the bill were not new powers to
supply the defects of a minority, but new powers
granted to the King. Should he appoint an improper
person, who could stand up to object to such great
persons? He wished he could see any general bill
of Regency; but when such difficulties were started
on these bills, he feared future kings and ministers
would recommend no more bills, therefore he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
wished to see a general one. He did not know which
he feared most, the union or the disunion of the Royal
Family. George Grenville said, he had the highest
authority for declaring that the powers to be granted
to his Majesty would be executed immediately, and
the public would know they were. “Would it be
only sealing the instrument,” Colonel Barré asked,
“or would the person named for Regent be known?”
“I said,” replied Grenville, “the powers would be
executed, and that it would be known they were; not
the person.” “The Crown knows,” said Colonel Barré
again, “that we are no Parliament of Paris, but proposes
matters to us, and we ought to show what we
think of them. Queen Mary asked the same power
as had been granted to her father, and was refused. It
shows, therefore, how ready the Crown is to take
advantage of precedents. The princes of the blood
might grow to court the Ministers; it was a bill to
encourage faction. Whither could the power be carried,
where it would be less likely to do mischief than
to the Queen! By not naming her, the House must
suppose the Queen might not be Regent, and so her
children would be torn from her by the will of her
consort. Perhaps the King wished to induce the Parliament
to name the Queen, that the Parliament
might then be bound to support her. Mr. Dowdeswell
had asked, whether, on an improper person being
named, the Parliament would object? Yes; even in
the reign of Charles II. the Parliament had spoken
out. Grenville, he believed, had not drawn the bill.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
It came from a quarter that made it wear all the
marks of ministerial distraction.” Whencesoever it
had issued, he believed those of his profession (the
military) would reap all the harvest. Averse as he
was to the Ministry, the bill, he thought, would torture
them more than they deserved. The motion
was rejected at six o’clock by 258 to 67.</p>

<p>As soon as the division was over, and while the
House was expecting Morton’s<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> motion, Mr. Conway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
came to me and said he would go away with
me, as would Sir William Meredith and others; and
that they would not vote in the question on the
Princess, but on the third reading of the bill, when
their vote would not be personal to her. I immediately
went out, but found nobody followed me. I
did not like to be single, and returned, but at last
carried Mr. Conway away. In the meantime, Morton
and Kynaston,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> a noted Jacobite, moved to reinstate
the Princess’s name in the bill. Samuel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
Martin, a servant of the Princess, and known from
his duel with Wilkes, spoke strongly for that measure;
declared he was totally unauthorized, and believed
her Royal Highness averse to be named. The
bill, he found, had been altered, by what means he
did not know; nor was it proper to tell if he did.
He must suppose the alteration came from nowhere
but the other House. None of the Royal Family but
the Princess were excluded. If the Queen should
die, who would be so proper for a Regent as her Royal
Highness? Why did the other House stigmatize or
put a brand on her? And then looking at Grenville,
he said, the Princess had had occasion to see
the professions made to her were not from the heart.
Dr. Blackstone spoke in the same behalf, as did the
younger George Onslow, who beseeched his friends to
look on him with an eye of pity, for being forced to
differ with them from conscience. In case of the
Queen’s death, the Princess, by law, was the most
proper person to replace her. The more persons
capable of the Regency, the worse; but when all
the rest were named in the bill, he could not consent
to exclude her Royal Highness. His cousin
took the other side, but called God to witness that
he intended no personality. He had been for the
nomination of the Queen, and now thought the
smaller the number the better. He had heard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
Secretary of State had procured the omission of the
Princess. This occasioned his being called to order.
Sir John Rushout, as the ancient oracle of the House,
declared that Onslow might say what he had heard
from common fame, but might not say he had heard
it himself. Onslow, on that authority, affirmed he
had been told that the Secretary of State did not
make the motion for omission of the Princess by
private authority; and on that authority he desired
explanation. Had the House of Commons received
such a message, it would have quieted them. The
present motion was cruel to the Princess: the correction
in the House of Lords, he was persuaded, was
not personal. Had the Duke of York been omitted,
his own objection to restoring the Duke’s name
would have been the same. Grenville<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> replied, that
the words moved by Lord Halifax were inserted to
prevent doubt: himself had thought they would not
be disagreeable to her Royal Highness—hoped they
were not—thought they would be universally acceptable—thought
there had been authority for the
omission, but found there was not; would concur in
any compliment to the mother of his sovereign.</p>

<p>This cold, half-owning, half-denying speech, completed
Grenville’s ruin with the Princess. Martin
vowed to God he did not know her opinion on the
question, and was believed as much as Grenville<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
and Onslow had been. Morton more artfully said,
that if her Highness had intended to send a message
to the House, it would not have been by so insignificant
a man as himself. Onslow said, he hoped it
would not be interpreted as if he meant to brand
the Princess. Whoever used that term, branded
the House of Lords. Lord Palmerston gave a
strong dissent to the motion, though he owned the
situation was disagreeable. The Princess, he said,
was excluded by a great and general line. The motion
then passed without a division, but with several
No’s. Equally to the disgrace of both sides, the
Ministers servilely revoking what they had insolently
and unjustifiably done; the Opposition withstanding
the reparation, yet not daring to avow,—nay,
disavowing the very motive of the obstruction
they gave.</p>

<p>I had thus, as I flattered myself, prevented the
greater number of our friends from personally offending
the Princess. My arguments and their own interest
had kept many from the House. I did not
doubt but the Ministers would be dismissed, if the
Court found that it had hopes of mollifying the
Opposition. But the next morning I perceived the
vertigo was returned with fresh force. On going
to the House, Sir William Meredith told me that
Onslow was determined to put it to a division
on the report, encouraged by the many negatives
on the Princess’s question. This was judging
weakly, for many would cry “No!” who would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
have voted, when they would have been personally
distinguished by a division. He added, that
Forester, the Duke of Bedford’s lawyer, had laughed
at them for not dividing. I was not the dupe of
that art; the less as Rigby had been the first to
acquaint Mr. Conway with Morton’s intended motion;
and to draw in our party, the Bedford faction
had given out that Forester would oppose the re-establishment
of the Princess’s name. Lord Rockingham
confirmed this intelligence—agreed with me,
but said he could not prevail on the Duke of Newcastle,
on whom I found the Bedfords had contrived
to make the impression they wished. Sir William
Meredith added that Onslow had said to him over
night, “I believe you, Conway, and T. Townshend
acted from conscience, but all the rest from interest.”
I replied, “Sir William, Onslow may say
what he pleases, yet he will accept a place before I
shall. I had rather be taxed with self-interest, than
call God to witness I mean no personality, when I
am doing the most personal thing in the world.”
Provoked at this new absurdity, I went away, depending
that Mr. Conway, who had retired with
me the day before, and had promised me not to
vote against the Princess, would be firm to his promise;
yet when the question came on, he had the
weakness, though he tried to prevent a division, to
vote with the Cavendishes against her. They pretended
to desire he would not, but knew how much
the fear of their silent reproaches would operate on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
him.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> Newcastle’s people were violent, and insisted
on a division, driven on by John White,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> an old republican,
who governed both Newcastle and Lord
John Cavendish, and who hoped this vote would
divide the Opposition from Mr. Pitt, whom White
hated, and who he certainly knew would never personally
affront the Court. Yet after all their hopes,
the result of this intemperate measure was a contemptible
minority of 37. What was more unlikely,
Rigby retired, and did not vote with the majority,
though he had declared nothing should make him
vote against the Princess. Her triumph would have
been complete, if anything could have effaced the
affront she had received, and which must remain on
record. What the few Whigs in that little minority
could plead in their defence, was difficult to say.
They had loudly condemned the motion for removing
Sir Robert Walpole on public fame, and now
endeavoured to stigmatize the Princess on the same
ground, without daring even to assign it as a pretence.
The conduct of the Ministers was still more
double; and many believed that the Duke of Cumberland’s
hatred of the Princess had drawn him at
last to concur with the Bedfords in instigating Newcastle
to this measure. Grenville scarce concealed
his sentiments; and Lord Burghersh telling him he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
would go away, rather than vote with the Tories,
unless he, Grenville, desired him not; the latter
bade him follow his own inclination—he stayed and
voted against the Princess.</p>

<p>After some other clauses proposed and rejected,
the Bill passed at eleven at night. During the debate
Onslow attacked Charles Townshend, (who had
spoken for the Court,) and congratulated the Treasury-bench
on their acquisition. Townshend replied
in one of his best speeches, but with his usual
want of judgment, boasted of his own steadiness for
sixteen years; saying, “Surely, in these times, with
a little common sense, I might have been dependent
if I had pleased.” The answer was obvious—“With
a little common sense you might.”</p>

<p>Rose Fuller declared that if the motion for reinstating
the Princess was rejected, he, to show his
impartiality, would move to omit her Royal Highness’s
daughters and Princess Amalie. It was said
with humour, that would be like Lord Anglesey,
who beating his wife,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> she said, “How much happier
is that wench (pointing to a housemaid) than I am!”
He immediately kicked the maid down stairs, and
then said, “Well! there is at least one grievance
removed.”</p>

<p>On the 13th, the bill, returned from the Commons,
with the name of the Princess Dowager reinserted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
was read in the House of Lords, and the
Ministers were to swallow the amendment, and palliate
their past conduct as well as they could. The
task was allotted to Lord Sandwich. He owned
Lord Halifax’s amendment had met with his hearty
concurrence, and he had expected it would have
passed through both Houses unanimously: had
thought it would be disapproved of by no person
whatever. But whether that amendment or the
correction of it should take place, the great point
would be obtained of ascertaining who were the persons
capable of the Regency. He hoped, therefore,
their Lordships would agree to the correction sent
up from the other House. Parliament could not
mean to exclude the Princess, if it would be disagreeable
to her Royal Highness, or to any other
person: the sole meaning had been to remove
doubts. Should he himself adhere to the former
words, he should be inconsistent, for those words
had no longer the same meaning; but he had
thought the amendment would have been universally
approved. He had meant to establish any description
that would be agreeable to the King and
people. It was now of consequence to be unanimous
in re-establishing the name of her Royal
Highness.</p>

<p>By Sandwich and Grenville dwelling so much
upon the expectation they had conceived, that the
omission of the Princess would be universally approved,
it was plain they had flattered themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
with acquiring such popularity by that act, that
the King would not dare to remove them. This
had driven them on the outrage they had committed.
The event proved just the contrary of
what they had expected. Obnoxious as the Princess
was, the heinousness of the insult to her, and
of the treachery to the King, shocked all mankind,
and seemed doubly offensive in men from whom
the King had a right to expect defence, and who
had plunged so deep into the most arbitrary and
unpopular measures. It was not by <em>their</em> hands that
the nation wished to see the Princess and Favourite
humbled. The same fate attended Sandwich now,
that had pursued the discovery of the “Essay on
Woman.” The profaneness of Wilkes, and the
unpopularity of the Princess, were forgotten in the
more odious means employed to disgrace them.</p>

<p>The Duke of Richmond took notice that the
words now inserted by the House of Commons
were precisely the same with those he had moved
himself, and was glad they were likely to be agreed
to; yet when he had proposed them, Lord Sandwich
had moved to adjourn. His own wish had
tended to precision; and his view, to pass the act
in the manner most agreeable to the King. When
Lord Halifax had brought other words, he had concluded
those words were agreeable to his Majesty,
for he believed <em>Lord Halifax</em> incapable of deceiving
the King or the House (this was pointed at Lord
Sandwich). He had now heard that their Lordships<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
must eat their words; and that what had
happened was a stigma on her Royal Highness.
Surely that was not paying court to her: such assertions
had more zeal than judgment in them; and
were injurious to the House. Lord Sandwich replied,
that he had moved to adjourn, because the
question had been too great to be determined suddenly:
he had not been against the Duke’s motion.
He knew of nothing injurious from the other House.</p>

<p>The Duke of Portland<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> disagreed with the new
amendment, because he recollected, he said, <em>the
authority</em> with which the omission of the Princess
had gone down to the other House. To reinstate
her now would be inconsistent and contradictory.
Lord Talbot said there was no inconsistency in
changing, when founded on the opinions of the
other House. It was advantageous to the constitution
to have the joint wisdom of both. Lord
Ravensworth said he had always been for naming
the Princess, yet disapproved the new amendment,
because the former amendment had come from the
King. The Duke of Newcastle dissented from the
amendment; protested he had no views; could
only serve his country by his opinion in that House.
He would not say the other House had no right to
make this amendment; but they had not shown
that respect to the Crown, or to their Lordships,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
that they had meant to show. It had been usual to
receive nominations or stipulations from the Crown.
The House of Commons should not have taken
upon themselves to nominate. He thought Lord
Halifax incapable of bringing anything but truth
from the King: he wished, therefore, the former
words had not been altered.</p>

<p>The present alteration was not warranted by precedent.
Lord Halifax’s motion had reduced the
number of those that were capable of the Regency,
and therefore was a desirable measure. Lord Denbigh
expressed his astonishment at the former extraordinary
motion, which had flowed from as extraordinary
a quarter. He had not been present,
yet should have voted for it, extraordinary as it was;
should wonder if their Lordships should not agree
to correct that wonderful measure. During the
meridian of Newcastle’s power, <em>now dwindled</em>, the
Princess was named Regent. If Prince Frederick<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>
should, by failure of the rest of the Royal Family,
come to be King before he was of age, the Princess,
by Newcastle’s bill, must be Regent. He believed
his Grace’s great age had made him forget one of
his favourite children. Lord Talbot said he did not
believe the Duke objected to the Princess, but
would have had the Commons consider the motion
as the King’s. He would not enter into the merits
of the Princess. Though he held that stick in his
hand (of Lord-Steward), he had never known a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
Court-secret. Should the King die, the Princess
would be too afflicted to act. He then ridiculed
the Opposition; and concluded with saying, “I was
once a patriot, my Lords, for patriotism is always
in opposition.” Lord Pomfret declared strongly in
favour of the Princess; and the amendment was
agreed to without a negative. The bill passed.</p>

<p>But though the Ministers had been forced to
make atonement, the sacrifice was by no means accepted.
The King treated them with every mark
of estrangement and aversion; and it was visible to
every eye that their fall was determined. Previous
to their dismission, they tasted of the horror in
which they were held by the people. The very day
on which the Regency-bill passed, the Lords read
another bill sent from the Commons, for imposing
as high duties on Italian silks as are paid on those of
France, on this foundation, that the French sent their
silks to Genoa and Leghorn, and then entered them
there as Italian merchandize. This bill had passed
the Commons with little notice, all attention having
been engrossed by the plan of the Regency. When
it was read by the Lords, the Duke of Bedford alone
spoke against it; nobody said a word for it, and it
was thrown out.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> It happened that the silk manufacture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
was at a low ebb, and many weavers in
Spitalfields were unemployed. The next day about
three or four thousand of those poor men went very
quietly and unarmed to Richmond, to petition the
King for redress. The Queen was walking in the
paddock, and was alarmed by their numbers; but
they gave no offence, and followed the King in the
same peaceable manner to Wimbledon, whither he
was gone to a review. The King told them, he
would do all that lay in his power to relieve them,
and they returned pleased and orderly.</p>

<p>But the next day, May 15th, whether they distinguished
between the assurances given by his
Majesty and the rejection of the bill by the Lords;
or whether, as is more probable, they had been instigated
under-hand, they went to the House of
Lords in great bodies, behaving in the most riotous
manner, abusing the Peers, and applauding the
Commons, who had passed their bill. The Chancellor’s<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>
coach they stopped, and asked him if he
had been against the bill? He stoutly replied, Yes.
They were abashed at his firmness, and said they
hoped he would do justice. He replied, “Always,
and everywhere; and whoever did, need fear nothing.”
When the Duke of Bedford appeared, they
hissed and pelted him; and one of the mob taking
up a large stone for the new pavement, dashed it
into the chariot: the Duke broke the force of the
blow by holding up his arm, but it cut his hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
and bruised him on the temple; so narrowly he
escaped with his life. They then followed him to his
own house, where with great temper he admitted
two of the ringleaders to a parley, and they went
away seemingly appeased.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>The next day the House of Lords issued out
orders for preservation of the peace; but the
weavers continued to parade the streets and the
park, though without committing any violence.</p>

<p>On the Friday, the Lords sent for Justice Fielding,
who said the weavers had done no mischief.
The Chancellor, who had been trusted by the Ministers
with none of their late extraordinary measures,
and who probably foresaw their downfall, was
sullen, and would take no part. Few Lords attended,
and everything announced to the Ministers
their approaching disgrace. About dinner-time, the
Duke of Bedford received intelligence that his
house would be assaulted at night, on which he sent
away his jewels and papers, and demanded a party
of horse; the Duchess<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> persisting in remaining with
him in the house. His friends and dependants, and
several officers, garrisoned it; and as was foreseen,
the rioters in prodigious numbers assaulted the
house in the evening, and began to pull down the
wall of the court;<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> but the great gates being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
thrown open, the party of horse appeared, and
sallying out, while the riot act was read, rode round
Bloomsbury Square, slashing and trampling on the
mob, and dispersing them; yet not till two or three
of the guards had been wounded. In the meantime
a party of the rioters had passed to the back
of the house, and were forcing their way through
the garden, when fortunately fifty more horse arriving,
in the very critical instant, the house was
saved, and perhaps the lives of all that were in it.
The Duke, however, and his company kept watch
all night; and the coffee-houses were filled with
curious and idle people, who sent with great indifference
every hour to learn how the siege went
on. The disappointed populace vented their rage
on the house of Carr, a fashionable mercer, who
dealt in French silks, and demolished the windows.
All Saturday they remained peaceable; and though
another attack on Bedford House was threatened,
no further mischief ensued.</p>

<p>On Sunday evening I went to compliment the
Duke and Duchess, as most of their acquaintance
did, on their escape. I found the square crowded,
but chiefly with persons led by curiosity. As my
chariot had no coronets, I was received with huzzas;
but when the horses turned to enter the court, dirt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
and stones were thrown at it. When the gates
opened, I was surprised with the most martial appearance.
The horse-guards were drawn up in the
court, and many officers and gentlemen were walking
about as on the platform of a regular citadel.
The whole house was open, and knots of the same
kind were in every room. When I came to the
Duchess, and lamented the insult they had suffered,
she replied, with warmth and acrimony, that the
mob had been set on by Lord Bute. I was not
much inclined to believe <em>that</em>, nor thought a mob a
tool with which Lord Bute would choose to amuse
himself. Immediately after, came in the Earl and
Countess of Northumberland. Words cannot describe
the disdainful manner in which they were received.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>
The Duke of Bedford left the room; the
Earl was not asked to sit, nor spoken to; but was
treated with such visible marks of neglect and aversion,
that Lord Waldegrave said to another of the
family, “Faith! this is too much.” In my own
opinion, the mob was blown up by Humphrey Cotes,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>
and the friends of Wilkes. Almond, the friend and
printer of the latter, owned to me, that they were
directed by four or five gentlemen in disguise, who
were not suspected; and seemed willing to disclose
the secret to me. I said, “Name no names to me,
I will not hear them.” He gave me a print published
by Cotes against Lord Bute and Lord Holland;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
and talked of risings that would be all over England.
I said, “I should be sorry to have the mob rise: it
would occasion the army being quartered in London,
and then we should be enslaved.”</p>

<p>Perhaps I have dwelt too minutely on this episode;
perhaps I have done so on many other points
equally unimportant. But it must be remembered
that I am painting a portrait of the times, rather
than writing history. The events, too, of this time
were so linked together, that trifles gave birth to
serious eras; and unless it be detailed with the
circumstantial exactness which I shall use, and
which I stood in a situation to know more thoroughly
than most men, from my intimacy or connection
with many of the actors, the history of this
reign will be very imperfectly understood; and posterity
would see sudden and extraordinary changes;
without being able to account for them from the
public appearances of things. When it is known,
it will be easy to compose a more compendious
account; and my narrative, that may serve for the
scaffolding, may be thrown by as no longer of use.</p>

<p>The King, on all other occasions so able and
steady a dissembler, did not affect now to disguise
the offence he had taken at his Ministers. He had
long inwardly groaned under their insolence and
disagreeable qualities: and though for some time
Lord Bute a little restrained his Majesty’s impatience
to throw them off, both the Favourite and
the mother had contributed to foment the King’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
aversion. The Duchess of Bedford had openly
affronted the Princess, and avowed her hatred to
Lord Bute. To Lord Sandwich the Favourite bore
private resentment, for having courted a little too
assiduously, though he was disappointed in the pursuit,
rich old Wortley Montagu, Lady Bute’s father.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>
But Grenville was the principal rock of offence.
I have mentioned his jealousy and ill-treatment of
the Favourite; his manners made him as distasteful
to the King, as his engrossing fondness for power
had made him to the Favourite. His ill-judged
economy had led him to refuse twenty thousand
pounds to the King, to buy the ground behind the
Green Park, where the King had made a new garden,
and where, by the loss of that purchase, a
new row of houses was erected, that overlooked the
King and Queen in their most domestic hours.
And, as if non-compliance with even his innocent
pleasures was not sufficiently offensive, that awkward
man of ways and means, whom Nature had
fitted for no employment less than a courtier’s,
fatigued the King with such nauseous and endless
harangues, that, lamenting being daily exposed to
such a political pedant, the King said to Lord Bute
of Grenville, “When he has wearied me for two
hours, he looks at his watch to see if he may not
tire me for an hour more.”</p>

<p>The measure of these disgusts was filled up by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
the conduct of the Ministers on the Bill of Regency;
yet, though that conduct threw down the
sluice, the resolution had been taken before to discard
them on the first opportunity. When the
Duke of Cumberland had waited on the King, before
setting out for Newmarket, his Majesty had
vented himself to his uncle on the uneasiness he
felt from being in their hands, and he must have
felt before he chose that Prince for his confident.
At Newmarket, the Earl of Northumberland had
private instructions to continue the negotiation, and
the Duke had listened with no unwilling ear, as I
have hinted before; yet he had been so over-prudent
as not to trust the secret to the chiefs of the Opposition,
who, driven on by Lord John Cavendish, had
intemperately displayed their aversion to the Princess
and Favourite, while they had not the least
suspicion that the Duke was secretly paving the
way for their return to Court. Yet even that
intemperate behaviour of the Cavendishes and their
friends could not deter the Court from the resolution
of removing the Ministers, whose crime appeared,
as indeed it was, of a much blacker dye.
Indeed, those of the Opposition who had gone the
greatest lengths, were not of importance enough to
make the Court lay aside its design. The royal
Junto depended on the support of the Duke of
Cumberland, and could not doubt but they might
have Newcastle, whenever they called for him: the
rest of course must follow their leaders. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
Court intended to avail itself of a still firmer support,
and that was Mr. Pitt’s, on whose easy compliance
they depended too inconsiderately—and
with still greater inconsideration, they began to
take the machine to pieces, before they had made
the common preparations for refitting it. This rash
conduct was probably inspired by the riot of the
weavers, which the Court regarded as the sense of
the nation expressed against the Administration.
Had the King temporized, he might have dealt to
advantage with any faction he chose. By beginning
with the dismission of the Ministers, he exposed
himself to the extravagant demands of all
who saw the dilemma to which he had reduced
himself, and the necessity he was under of submitting
to some disagreeable set of men or other, who
were sure to make him purchase dearly a support
that they knew he wished not to accept at all.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang65 b2">The King’s differences with his Ministers.—Negotiations with Mr.
Pitt to form a new Administration.—Contemplated appointment
of a Captain-General.—Reconciliation of Lord Temple and Mr.
Grenville.—Ministers recalled.—Dismissal of Mr. Mackenzie.—Parliament
Prorogued.</p></blockquote>

<p>On May the 18th, Grenville went to receive the
King’s orders for the speech at the close of the
session, which was to end the next week. The
King said, coldly, there was no hurry; he would
have the Parliament adjourned, not prorogued.
Grenville, thunderstruck, said, “There was so much
mystery in that speech, that he must beg leave to
ask if his Majesty had any thoughts of making a
change in his Administration?”—“Certainly,” replied
the King; “I cannot bear it as it is. I will
have the Parliament only adjourned.” “I hope,”
replied Grenville, “your Majesty will not order me
to cut my own throat.”—“Then,” said the King,
“who must adjourn the Parliament?”—“Whoever
your Majesty shall appoint my successor,” said
Grenville.</p>

<p>The Ministers, on the communication of this
notice, took the only sensible step that remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
in their situation, which was, by dissolving the Administration
themselves, to involve the King in
such a labyrinth of negotiations and demands, as
might end in nothing, and reduce him to apply
again to them. Accordingly, Bedford, Grenville,
and the two Secretaries of State acquainted his
Majesty they should resign on the following Tuesday,
if no Administration was formed by that time.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>Hostilities thus commenced, other secrets came
out. It was known that the design of the Court
was to place the Earl of Northumberland at the
head of the Treasury. The Duke of Cumberland
had come into the plan, and Lord Albemarle had
been sent very privately to Hayes, to ask Mr. Pitt’s
assistance and junction in that scheme. Pitt’s
behaviour was neither promising nor condescending.
Yet, both the King and the Duke were so bent
on union with him, that Lord Albemarle had been
despatched again to Hayes with repeated offers.
Pitt talked in general terms of a total alteration
of measures; of a strict alliance against France;
and of condemnation of General Warrants, though
to be turned in some shape that might save his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
Majesty’s honour. Still, however, he kept great
reserve, and to draw the fuller <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">éclat</i> from the negotiation,
let Lord Albemarle perceive that he would
not deign to negotiate with a substitute, but expected
a personal interview with the Duke of Cumberland
himself. Even this was granted, and (it
was thought) wisely, as, if Pitt could be awed, it
must be by so able and respectable a Prince. On
the other hand, some men feared that Pitt’s haughtiness
was more likely to augment than stoop to
any dignity below the throne.</p>

<p>On the 20th, his Royal Highness went to Hayes.
With much elevation, Pitt did not seem untractable.
He made three principal demands: Regulation of
General Warrants; Restitution of Officers; Alliances
with Protestant Powers. The first article the
Duke told him would be accorded; the King himself
had named the second; the third would be most
subject to difficulty. Of domestic regulations, Pitt
only named the Chief Justice Pratt for Chancellor,
which the Court endeavoured to elude by the offer
of a peerage instead of the Seals. The Duke at last
said that, though not authorized, he would venture
to offer him <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carte blanche</i>. Lord Temple should
have the Treasury, Lord Northumberland would
take any other post. Mr. Pitt said, Lord Temple
would not take the Treasury, but some other place—if
any: nor would he promise that himself would
take any part in the new system.</p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland, before he went to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
Hayes, had sent for Lord Temple to town; and it
was observed, that from the time <em>that</em> lord saw Mr.
Pitt, the difficulties and reluctance of the latter
were visibly augmented.</p>

<p>One of my most earnest wishes was to see Mr.
Pitt restored to the head of the Administration.
Nobody knew his faults better, but nobody admired
his genius more; no man had felt greater pride
than I had felt, from the glorious position in which
he had placed my country. The moment I learnt
the negotiation, I laboured to my utmost to draw
my friends to support him, if he should become
Minister. Nor had I previously neglected to excuse
their late behaviour, of which I persuaded Lord
Holland they repented. He wished them to notify
their sorrow in form: but though I was willing to
have that signified, yet I could not expect the
Cavendishes would recant: nor was I in haste to
press it, as I waited for what I soon heard—the
treaty with Pitt. Lord Holland said he was convinced
the King would never forgive Lord Halifax
and the Duke of Bedford, and would dismiss them
if he could; but Grenville, he thought, would be
saved, as he had had no hand in the transaction.
“No hand!” said I, “he was as deep as any of them.”
“Against the Princess, I allow he was,” said Lord
Holland; “but did not contribute to draw the
King into that cruel step.” This exception appeared
so strange to me, that I almost thought there
was truth in a saying of that time—that Grenville<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
must remain Minister, because there was no other
man in a tye-wig fit to preside at the Board of
Treasury. I found from Lord Holland, that he
had been denied access to Lord Bute, who had sent
him word he could not see him, as so great a crisis
was at hand, in which he himself had no share.
The very message proved the contrary. If the
message was true, and not concerted between them,
it must have been a silly evasion prepared by Bute,
that he might assure Pitt he had not seen Lord
Holland; or to disguise to the latter the treaty
with the former. It is not even improbable that
Lord Bute had tasted so much vexation from the
Regency-bill, which Lord Holland had earnestly
pressed upon him, that he might not be inclined to
have recourse to the same councils again. Lord
Holland, however, let me discover how anxiously
he wished to overturn the Ministers, be the means
what they would. He dropped to me these remarkable
words—“What an artful man might do
with these mobs!” But I was not a man to dip my
hand in such resources.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>On the day that the Duke of Cumberland went
to Hayes, a committee of the House of Lords sat
on the Riots. Lord Sandwich said, he hoped their
Lordships would adjourn till the Duke of Bedford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
could come in safety to the House. Lord Halifax
said, there were rumours of a change of Ministers;
but it was impossible the King could give up so
faithful a servant as the Duke of Bedford to the
mob; and threw out many insinuations of the mob
being stirred up by Lord Bute. Lord Pomfret
took this up with great warmth; but during the
altercation the Lords were informed that the
Sheriffs of London (probably by concert with the
Ministers) attended with material information.
Lord Halifax went out to them; and returning,
said, there was a diabolic plot. Being called in,
the Sheriffs said they had received certain information
that the weavers were to rise in arms at five
in the morning, were to be joined by the butchers
and watermen, and destroy Bedford House. The
Chancellor said the notice ought to be laid before
both Houses; but the Lords contented themselves
with voting an address to the King for a proclamation
against the rioters, with giving directions to
the civil magistrates to secure the peace, and with
granting an additional guard of one hundred men
for Bedford House, as the Duke had desired.</p>

<p>The next day Mr. Conway brought me intelligence
that gave me inexpressible concern, and struck
me with more alarm than any public measure I ever
knew. It was, that Lord Halifax had written to
the King that his Ministers advised his Majesty to
employ Lord Granby as the most popular man in
England, and the Duke of Richmond and Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
Waldegrave as generals under him, to suppress the
riot—advice that breathed the desperate ambition
of the ministerial faction, and showed their intention
of usurping the government by force: Lord
Granby having assured them at a council of their
friends, that he would firmly adhere to them. But
this was not the part of the intelligence that most
alarmed me: it was the consequence of this letter,
the King on the receipt of it having written to his
uncle that he would immediately name his Royal
Highness Captain-General. This was at once firing
the signal of civil war: the generals were named on
either side. I implored Mr. Conway to hasten to
the Duke, and prevent, if possible, before it was too
late, so rash and fatal a step: it would be sufficient
for the King to refuse delegating Lord
Granby. The Duke begged the King to suspend
his resolution, and told him, that if he accepted the
nomination, it should only be for the present, and
he would appoint Lord Albemarle to act under him.
And he sent to Lord Granby, that he should accept
the charge but for the purpose of suppressing the
riots, and that he should not in any other point interfere
with his Lordship. This, though it showed
temper, discovered but too great alacrity to undertake
the commission. To Hayes, too, his Royal
Highness despatched Lord Frederick Cavendish, to
acquaint Mr. Pitt with the intended measure. Mr.
Pitt with his wonted elevation treated the matter
lightly, and said the riots were of no consequence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
The dismission of the Ministers he approved of, in
consequence of their actions: if only as enemies of
Lord Bute, the case was different. He had no objection
to Lord Bute as Favourite, but as he disagreed
with him on measures.</p>

<p>The Ministers determined to push their blow,
prevailed on the Duke of York, who they meant
should balance his uncle, to go to Richmond, and
in their names to advise his Majesty to come and
stay in town. Many of the Tories, dreading the
power of the Duke of Cumberland, declared they
would abandon Bute and adhere to Grenville.
Fortunately the Duke himself told the King that
the riots were not of consequence enough for him
to be appointed Captain-General. The Favourite,
too, had taken alarm, and apprehending a parliamentary
motion against himself, had summoned all the
Scotch to attend the House. Thus blew over a
cloud that might have been productive of such fatal
events!</p>

<p>The negotiation in the mean time with Mr.
Pitt continued, but made no advance. The Duke
of Cumberland understood that he refused to come
into place, and proposed to the King to form an
Administration without him. The Duke of Newcastle,
though he would not venture to take any
responsible place himself, was eager for the same
measure; and the Cavendishes were not less ready
to join such a system. It was proposed to place
Lord Lyttelton at the head of the Treasury, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
Charles Townshend as Chancellor of the Exchequer,
and General Conway Secretary at War. The latter
and I saw the inefficacy of this expedient, and
protested against it. Such an Administration we
agreed could not last six months. The Opposition
would be said to join Lord Bute, and would suffer
in their reputation. Finding so few facilities, the
Duke determined to make one more essay, and
desired Lord Lyttelton to go to Hayes, and know the
last resolution of Mr. Pitt. What words can paint
the astonishment of Lord Lyttelton, or indeed of
mankind, when that Lord, who was to carry Lord
Temple to Hayes with him, was informed at Lord
Temple’s door, that Mr. George Grenville was alone
with his brother? Lord Lyttelton waited two hours
with Lady Temple. It was by that time too late to go
to Hayes till after dinner. Lord Temple vouchsafed
to make no explanation to Lord Lyttelton, but said
it was only a private reconciliation. He said the same
the next day when, with Lord Lyttelton, he waited
on the Duke of Cumberland; adding, that their reconciliation
did not extend to political connection.
“But that, I suppose, my Lord,” said that sensible
Prince, “will soon follow.” Lord Lyttelton had
previously waited on his Royal Highness at his return
from Hayes, and owned that he could not say
Mr. Pitt and Lord Temple were agreed, though
still they were open to treat. Lord Temple complained
to the Duke that the King had been advised
to take his old Ministers again; and wondered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
who had advised it. “I did, my Lord,” said the
Duke firmly, “thinking Mr. Pitt’s a flat refusal, and
finding nobody else would engage without him.”
Before they parted, the Duke made Lord Temple
own, that <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carte blanche</i> had been offered to Mr. Pitt;
yet that point Mr. Pitt and his friends never allowed.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<p>What the Duke had said, was true. He no
sooner heard of the reconciliation in the family of
Grenville, than he advised the King to submit, and
take up with his old Ministers. The reconciliation
explained Mr. Pitt’s conduct, and the seeming variations
in it; for though in terms he never consented
to accept, the Duke owned to Mr. Conway,
that he had talked as if actually in place. He had
said, “Pratt will be at the head of the law.”—“I
said no such thing,” said the Duke; “the King
may be engaged to Mr. Yorke; I know nothing of
it.” Pitt replied, if he did come in, he could not
depend on the faith of the Court, and on influence
in the Cabinet; “I do not know, Sir,” continued he,
“if I can even depend on your Royal Highness’s
influence.” “No, indeed,” replied the Duke, “for
I shall have no influence there myself. The King
called me to this business, and the moment it is
over, I shall retire to Windsor.” But these irregularities
had all flowed from the conduct of Lord
Temple, who had thrown every obstruction in the
way of the negotiation, and had affected even to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
complain of the Duke of Newcastle, for proposing
Lord Lyttelton for the head of the Treasury, though
he himself could not be persuaded by Mr. Pitt to
accept it. It may be remembered, that in my visit
to Stowe, I had discovered how little cordiality subsisted
between Lord Temple and Mr. Pitt. From
that time, the former had certainly leaned towards
his brother George; and, as if the love of confusion
predominated even over his ambition, he had selected
this important moment to clog Mr. Pitt’s measures
by openly rushing into connection with his brother
George. Lord Bristol,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> and Augustus Hervey,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> had,
at Lord Temple’s desire, negotiated the reconciliation;
and besides the very lucrative interest that
Grenville had in accepting the offer, it was doubly
sweetened now by the defeat it gave to Mr. Pitt,
who in honour would not, or in prudence could not,
enter upon Administration by a breach with his
brother-in-law, his benefactor, and popular associate,
Temple, and only for being reconciled to their common
brother, George Grenville.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> The reversion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
Lord Temple’s estate<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> could make even the inflexible
Grenville stoop; and if his acrimonious heart
was obliged to pardon his brother, it was indemnified
by revenge on his sister’s husband. Mr.
Pitt, when Lord Temple and he parted, said pathetically,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Extinxti me teque, soror; populumque Patresque<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sidonios, urbemque tuam!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The Ministers, who no doubt had learnt from
Lord Temple the King’s distress, went to his Majesty
on the 22nd, and being acquainted that it was
his purpose to retain them in his service, insolently
told him that they must ask three things. First,
Would his Majesty promise, on his royal word, not
to consult Lord Bute any more, nor suffer him to
interfere in business? Secondly, Would he dismiss
Mr. Mackenzie<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> from the direction of Scottish
affairs? Thirdly, Would he immediately declare
Lord Granby Captain-General? The King said the
last would be the greatest affront imaginable to his
uncle, after he had been thought of for Captain-General.
Grenville replied insolently, he did not understand
why his Royal Highness was so often at
Court. “But,” continued the King, “are these
questions, or terms?” They said, “Questions.”
“But do you mean,” said the King, “to adhere to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
them as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sine quâ non</i>?”—“We do,” replied they.
The King said, he would give them an answer at
night.</p>

<p>In the evening, the King, instead of seeing
them, sent for the Chancellor, and ordered him to
carry his answer to the Ministers. It was: that
there was no longer any question about Lord Bute:
but his Majesty would give his word not to see
him. He would dismiss Mr. Mackenzie,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> but would
by no means yield to make Lord Granby Captain-General.
But though the stand-out of prudence
was made on the last article, the indignity offered
personally to the King on the second was the most
crying. Mr. Mackenzie had possessed a place of
2000<i>l.</i> a year for life. To accommodate some arrangement
in Scotland, he had given it up, and the
King had given him another of 3000<i>l.</i> a year; but
it not being a patent place for life, the King had
promised him, upon his honour, that it should
never be taken away during his reign. This severe
sacrifice the insolent faction now extorted; the
Court, in its present distress, not daring to venture
a rupture, of which any part of Lord Bute’s
family should be the cause.</p>

<p>The Ministers did not hesitate long; though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
Rigby tried to enforce<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> their adherence to all the
three demands. They waited on the King the next
day, declaring their acceptance of the two conditions,
but annexing a third, the dismission of Lord
Holland from the Pay-office, which was granted
without a murmur; though, when Lord Holland
had undertaken to carry through the Peace, the
King said to his wife, he should never forget the
obligation.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> The King ordered Lord Sandwich to
write the letter of his dismission, but Sandwich
had the decency to excuse himself, having lived
even till now on friendly terms with Lord Holland,
and then actually inhabiting the Pay-office, which
Lord Holland had lent him the two last years.
Charles Townshend succeeded Lord Holland, though
he had been designed Chancellor of the Exchequer
by the Opposition, and acted with them when they
came into power; and to complete the disgrace of
Lord Bute’s family, and as if wantonly to mark their
disregard to all propriety, the Ministers removed
Lord Northumberland from the government of Ireland,
and named for his successor the Viscount
Weymouth,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> an inconsiderable, debauched young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
man, attached to the Bedfords, but so ruined by
gaming, that the moment before his exaltation, he
was setting out for France, to avoid his creditors.
The Duke of Cumberland retired to Windsor, declaring
he had done with Opposition. His whole
conduct, indeed, in this transaction, had been noble,
and becoming the relation in which he stood to the
Crown. He had forgiven all the slights he had
experienced from the Court, had handsomely taken
up the cause of his nephew, and had even submitted
to act as messenger to Mr. Pitt. The
Dukes of Richmond and Manchester<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> had offered
his Royal Highness their assistance against the
Ministers. The former, enraged at the disgrace of
his brother-in-law Lord Holland, wished to reconcile
him to the Duke, but the Prince would lend
no ear to it. Nor, unsuccessful and baffled as our
party had been, did they grow at all more reasonable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
Lord Frederick Cavendish, probably from
knowing the inclinations of the Duke of Cumberland,
was desirous his brothers should soften towards
Lord Bute. I, too, saw the necessity of that
step; as, added to our own numbers, we should
have the favour of the Crown, and the support of
Lord Bute, Lord Northumberland, Lord Holland,
and their friends. “It is true, we should,” said
Lord Frederick, when I mentioned this; “but then,
we should have Mr. Pitt against us.” “I doubt it:
Mr. Pitt was not disposed to offend the King: he
never was heartily a friend to <em>us</em>;” and his subsequent
conduct proved how much he preferred any
connection to union with George Grenville.</p>

<p>The privy seal of Scotland thus wrenched from
Mackenzie, was offered to Lord Lorn:<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> he declining
it, it was bestowed on his brother Lord Frederick
Campbell, who, with unparalleled ingratitude and
indecency, accepted it. He was nearly related to
Mackenzie, had lived in the strictest intimacy with
him, and had received from Lord Bute a place in
Scotland of above 400<i>l.</i> a year for life, by a preference
that had made two considerable chiefs in
that country the mortal enemies of the Favourite.
Thurlow,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> an able lawyer, was named secretary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
Lord Weymouth; and Lord Warkworth, the Earl
of Northumberland’s son, was set aside from being
Master of the Horse to the Queen, to which he was
destined by the Court, in the room of Lord Weymouth.</p>

<p>To complete their vengeance even on inferior
offenders, the Ministers caused the House of Lords
to inflict severe penalties on several printers, and to
reprimand Justice Fielding, the blind, but only useful
magistrate, for having been negligent during the
late riots. Yet as so much persecution and arrogance
could not but excite much ill-will and mutual
hostilities, it now came out that, before the loss of
their bill, the weavers, suspecting that Lord Hilsborough
was against them, had waited on him to
implore his protection. To convince them he was
not their enemy, he showed them a letter from
Lord Halifax, in which the latter had begged him
not to oppose the bill, Lord Halifax having an
estate in Spitalfields, which would be greatly benefited
by the success of the bill. To this the
weavers had trusted; and the disappointment had
blown up their fury. How Lord Halifax came not
to support his own interest, or how it was compensated
to him, did not appear. But with this triumph
over all their foes, the Ministers put an end to the
session by proroguing the Parliament, May 25th.
Ten days more crowded with events scarce ever
passed; for the Regency-bill was finished on the
14th, and between that and the 25th had happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
the riot, the King’s declaration of his intention to
dismiss the Ministers, the several journeys to Hayes,
the reconciliation of Lord Temple and Grenville,
the various attempts to form another Administration,
the recall of the Ministers, and the several
instances of their revenge and insolence. The King
was left a prisoner to the Cabal, Lord Bute punished
by the very instruments of all his bad acts, and
Lord Holland disgraced by his once dear allies, the
Bedfords and Rigby. The only joy the nation could
feel was in seeing such poetic justice, for if they
pitied not the sufferers, they could but abhor the
executioners. If Lord Bute had advised the Peace,
the Duke of Bedford had negotiated it. If General
Warrants were employed for his service, Lord Halifax
had issued them. If he had had any hand in
the dismission of officers, Grenville had executed it.
And if he had authorized the severe proscription of
opponents, Lord Holland had marked the victims.
Ampler atonement was still due; and it was not
long delayed.</p>

<p>Defeated as the King’s attempts had been to
deliver himself from the thrall of his Ministers, he
could not sit patient under so many indignities.
The insult offered to his mother, and the breach of
his own royal promise imposed on him, were injuries
not to be pardoned. His resentment broke out on
every occasion, and the Parliament was no sooner
prorogued than he took all opportunities of frowning
on his tyrants and thwarting their desires. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
Ministers proposed to make Lord Waldegrave or
Lord Suffolk Master of the Horse to the Queen.
Her Majesty said no Minister should interfere in
<em>her</em> family, and named the Duke of Ancaster.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> The
first regiment that became vacant, the King bestowed
on Lord Albemarle’s brother, General Keppel.
The young Duke of Devonshire, by the King’s
desire, was carried to Court by his uncles; and the
Duke of Cumberland was still ready, as the King
knew, to protect him against the Cabal. His Royal
Highness said to Lord John Cavendish, “I can oppose
the Crown when Ministers do wrong, but will
now support it when it is insulted.”</p>

<p>Presuming on their superiority in Parliament,
and hurt at the marks of the King’s aversion, the
Ministers determined once more to subdue him
totally, or reduce him to new distresses. On the
12th of June<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> the Duke of Bedford, accompanied
by Grenville, Sandwich, and Halifax, waited on his
Majesty with a remonstrance, which the Duke had
drawn up, which took an hour in reading, and
which, though it had been much softened by Grenville
in their private meeting, the King had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
greatest difficulty to command himself enough to
hear it read to the end. It tended to give him
a month to consider whether he would take a new
ministry or retain the old. In the latter case he
was told that he must smile on his Ministers, and
frown on their adversaries, whom he was reproached
in no light terms with having countenanced contrary
to his promise. Invectives against the Princess
were not spared; nor threats of bringing Lord Bute
to the block. The King made no answer, but made
a bow as a signal for them to retire. When they
were gone, he said that if he had not broken out
into the most profuse sweat, he should have been
suffocated with indignation.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
No redress was left but to apply once more to
Mr. Pitt; and should he again decline, to form
some desperate Administration of Lord Bute’s
friends, and any detached persons that would join
in so unpromising a system. To prevent the former—at
least, to detach Lord Temple from Mr. Pitt—the
Dukes of Bedford and Marlborough offered to
resign either of their places in favour of the former.
Temple, though expressing his good wishes, declared
he would take nothing with the Administration as it
then stood, but should like to see a new one formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
out of all parties. Yet the Court did not despair of
Mr. Pitt’s concurrence. James Grenville told Colonel
Fitzroy that Mr. Pitt wished to see his brother,
the Duke of Grafton, who had particularly
distinguished himself by attachment to Pitt. The
Duke, however, was so cautious that he would not
go unless Mr. Pitt would directly request it; but
sent Fitzroy to Hayes to know if Mr. Pitt desired
to see him. Fitzroy stayed three hours and a half,
while Pitt, in his vague inconclusive manner, was
profuse of words, which did not tend to any definite
meaning. It was rather a complaint of the late application.
He said, that in August, two years before,
he had been promised the King’s countenance;
now no such thing had been mentioned, but that
bubble Lord Northumberland had been pressed
upon him, and the Duke of Cumberland had even
urged it to him for an hour and a half. That he
had not wanted the Treasury for Lord Temple, nor
would have filled the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carte blanche</i> if it had been
given to him. After much desultory conversation
of the like sort, Fitzroy said, “Then, Sir, the result
of all is, that you are resolved not to treat any
more.” “Resolved! that is a strong word,” replied
Pitt; “but this is my answer; Mr. Pitt’s determinations
are fixed: all negotiation is at an end.”</p>

<p>The Duke of Grafton soon followed his brother.
Mr. Pitt told him that Mr. Grenville had been
there, and had begun to talk politics, but he had
stopped him, and said, “Sir, a truce to your politics,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
for I never will talk politics with you again as long
as I live.” In this visit the Duke thought he did
not perceive a total unwillingness in Mr. Pitt still
to listen to accommodation. On that report, and
urged by the necessity of making one more attempt,</p>

<p>On the 17th the Duke of Grafton was again dispatched
to Hayes to tell Mr. Pitt that the King
was convinced he could not do without him, and to
invite him to Court. Mr. Pitt replied he was ready
to come, if his Majesty would graciously condescend,
in consideration of his lameness, to see him on the
ground-floor. Accordingly,</p>

<p>On the 19th he was three hours and a quarter
with the King at the Queen’s house, and as long on
the 22nd again, professing his readiness to undertake
the direction of affairs. Everything he asked
was accorded; particularly a close alliance with
Prussia if possible. He named Lord Temple for
the Treasury; the Duke of Grafton for Secretary of
State, with himself; Sir George Saville for Secretary
at War; Keppel and Saunders for Commissioners
of the Admiralty, he did not care in whose
room, nor should he be violent in turning out;
though, as so many had suffered, there must be a
large sweep.</p>

<p>During this transaction Pitt would not deign to
make any communication to the Duke of Cumberland,
who, notwithstanding, behaved nobly, said he
would do all the good he could, and would take
nothing ill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
Two days after these conferences, arrived Lord
Temple from Stowe, and went to Hayes. The next
day he waited on the King, and refused to accept
the Treasury, saying he had a delicacy which must
always remain a secret. This was generally supposed
to be levelled at Lord Bute. Some thought
of the Duke of Cumberland, and others that it
regarded his own brother, George Grenville. But
surely Lord Temple was not so overrun with delicacy
that he could afford to make a secret of the
only delicacy he seemed ever to have felt, the turning
out his own brother to take his place himself!</p>

<p>The next day Pitt waited on the King again, and
declared he was still ready to accept, if Lord Temple
would; and in the presence of the latter, told
his Majesty that for himself he was satisfied, and
trusted his royal declarations. And to the Duke of
Grafton he said, that he lamented with tears in his
eyes Lord Temple’s refusal to accept. That Duke
urged Lord Temple warmly, and told him he would
forfeit all character if he remained obstinate; but
when power could not influence him, what could
reproaches do? He persisted, and Mr. Pitt would
not take his part without him. Pitt had certainly
made nearer advances to Lord Bute in this negotiation
than the King either asked or expected; and
Lord Temple, who never failed to take any credit to
himself at the expense of his friends, openly calumniated
Mr. Pitt for leaning towards Lord Bute,
whom, he said, he himself had not ventured to trust.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
Pitt, it was true, had told the King that his Majesty
ought in conscience to restore Mackenzie—and
in truth both sense and honour dictated that advice
to any man who entered into his Majesty’s service.
In the City, Lord Temple’s emissaries abused Mr.
Pitt for too much <em>Butism</em>, as Lord Sandwich did for
his eagerness to promote a new war on the Continent.
But what could excuse the conduct of Lord
Temple, who, having an opportunity of redressing
all the breaches of the Constitution, against which
he had been so clamorous, now not only waived
that duty, but leagued with the very men whom
their own guilt and his voice and pen had pointed
out as the criminals?<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland now fearing that the
King’s desperate position would drive him to form an
Administration, with Lord Egmont at the head of the
Favourite’s faction, which the Court had thought of,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
pressed the Whigs to undertake the Administration,
and proposed Lord Rockingham for head of the
Treasury. In consequence of this desire, a meeting
of the chiefs of the Opposition in town was held at
Claremont June the 30th. There were present,
Newcastle himself, Lord Rockingham, the Duke of
Portland and his brother, the three Cavendishes,
Lord Grantham, General Conway, Thomas Walpole,
George Onslow, Lord Ashburnham, two of the
Townshends, and Lord Villiers.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> The question of
acceptance was debated; Newcastle answered for
the Duke of Grafton’s readiness. Portland was
warm on the same side, but proposed to turn out
Lord Bute’s people. The rest were very doubtful.
Newcastle declared his willingness to accept, but as
he could not answer for all his friends, he desired
each would deliver his opinion separately. Charles
Townshend,<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> Lord Ashburnham,<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> T. Walpole, Onslow,
and Lord Villiers disapproved of coming in
without Mr. Pitt. Onslow pressed them to wait,
as he said he hoped there would soon be a coalition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
of all parties against Lord Bute. T. Walpole<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a>
would not even promise to support so unpromising
an Administration. Conway thought it perilous,
but would not decline the danger. The rest agreed
with Newcastle.</p>

<p>I was ill in bed and could not be present at the
meeting; but when Conway reported the particulars
to me, I thought I never heard a more wild proposal,
nor one fraught with greater improbability
of success. The nomination of Lord Rockingham
for Minister at any season would have sounded preposterous;
in the present, sufficient alone to defeat
the system. Nor had I a more advantageous opinion
of the rest that were to compose it: all young
and inexperienced men, unknown to the nation,
and great by nothing but their rank and fortunes.
Conway agreed with me, but professed that if
the Duke of Cumberland laid his commands on
him to accept, he would not flinch from the enterprise.</p>

<p>The next day Newcastle reported to his Royal
Highness the indifferent success of the assembly,
yet with such eagerness to come again into power,
that he answered for Lord Ashburnham, and gave
hopes of prevailing with the rest. The Duke, not
apt to be daunted, encouraged the trial; and thus,
without any new consultation, his Royal Highness
acquainted the King that he was ready to form an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
Administration for him. To disgust those who still
adhered to Mr. Pitt, the Duke said he would now
disclose what he had not told before, that Mr. Pitt,
when he parted with the King, had told his Majesty
that, though he thought Mr. Grenville the
meanest and weakest of Ministers, yet there was no
man he should advise his Majesty to employ so
soon. This anecdote was confirmed by Mr. Pitt’s
conduct in the next year. Censured, however, as
Mr. Pitt was, his conduct was both prudent and
honourable. Nothing had barred his acceptance
but Lord Temple’s refusal of co-operating with him.
Himself told the elder T. Townshend that, had he
been younger, or had had one friend to whom he
could have entrusted the Treasury, he would have
undertaken the Administration without Lord Temple;
but this was not the sole occasion in which he
found the disadvantage of having kept all connections
at a distance. Lord Temple’s defection he
termed an amputation.</p>

<p>The King did not hesitate a moment to receive
the new arrangement proposed by his uncle, nor
clogged it with either terms or objections. Whatever
was asked was instantly granted; and if no
such courtly overtures were made, as Mr. Pitt had
dropped to ingratiate himself with the favourite
star, the Duke had, however, the address to ward
off any unwelcome conditions from being imposed
upon the King. Indeed, no conditions at all were
proposed. The Whigs, content with the power of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
doing right, as their subsequent actions proved had
been their intention, forbore to stipulate for redress
of grievances; and though the King might expect
more complaisance on certain points than he afterwards
experienced, he was too glad to be revenged
on his old Ministers, and too content with finding
no unwelcome sacrifices demanded, to boggle at a
treaty which was restricted solely to the disposition
of places. Many of the new placemen were not less
rejoiced to find themselves exalted above their most
sanguine expectations; though that precipitate rise
ought to have admonished them of the weakness
and instability of their party. But the rage of the
fallen Ministers exceeded, out of all proportion, the
joy both of their masters and successors. And as
defeated insolence soon turns to despondency, they
were abject enough to deny that they had driven
the King a second time to take his part. It was
too late now to repent, and the new Ministers
kissed hands on July the 8th.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
The Marquis of Rockingham was appointed First
Lord of the Treasury; the Duke of Grafton and
General Conway, Secretaries of State; the Duke
of Newcastle, Lord Privy Seal; and the old Earl of
Winchelsea, likewise coupled with this juvenile
troop, was made President of the Council; and Mr.
Dowdeswell,<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> Chancellor of the Exchequer. The
Duke of Portland succeeded Earl Gower as Lord
Chamberlain. Thomas Townshend<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> the younger,
Lord John Cavendish, and George Onslow were
appointed Commissioners of the Treasury. Lord
George Cavendish and Sir George Saville, though
firm friends to the new system, handsomely declined
accepting places. The Earl of Egmont, the only
friend of Lord Bute that was advanced, was made
First Lord of the Admiralty, with the Admirals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
Keppel and Saunders, Sir William Meredith, and
the Spanish Charles Townshend. Thomas Pitt, in
compliment to his uncle, was offered to remain at
that board, but chose to follow Mr. Grenville. The
Earl of Ashburnham was made Keeper of the Great
Wardrobe; Lord Barrington, Secretary at War,
instead of Treasurer of the Navy; the Earl of Besborough
and Lord Grantham, joint Postmasters.
Lord Powis<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> was turned out of Treasurer of the
Household, to make room for Lord Edgcumbe;<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>
and the Earl of Scarborough<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> succeeded Lord Thomond,
who resigned with his brother Grenville, as
Cofferer. Thomas Pelham<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> replaced Lord Charles
Spencer as Comptroller; Lord Villiers was made
Vice-Chamberlain in the room of William Finch,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a>
who retired with a pension; and Lord Gage,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> Paymaster
of the Pensions, in the room of Mr. Neville.
Inferior promotions it is not necessary to recapitulate:
let it suffice to say, that the new Ministers
dismissed but two of Lord Bute’s friends, Lord Despencer
and one who will be mentioned hereafter.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
On the other hand, the Duke of Cumberland had
wished to detach the Duke of Bedford from Grenville,
(an object only desirable for the breach it
would have made in their party,) and sent General
Fitzwilliam with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carte blanche</i> to Rigby. The latter
rejected it with scorn, and with ample abuse on
his Royal Highness as a politician.</p>

<p>I have specified the new plan as it took place, but
must take notice now of some steps leading to it.
Grenville, on his reconciliation with his brother, had
notified it to the King in a long declamation. The
King answered, He did not trouble himself with
the friendships of others, and wished nobody would
with his. When the change was determined, the
Chancellor received the King’s orders to write to
Grenville and the two Secretaries of State to bring
their seals the next day. The Duke of Marlborough,
Earl Gower, and Rigby resigned.</p>

<p>In the first draught of the new settlement it was
proposed that Mr. Conway should be Chancellor of
the Exchequer; and for some time Lord Rockingham
refused to accept without that assistance. Conway’s
inclination was to be Secretary at War; his
resolution not to quit the military line. I, who
knew his unacquaintance with the business of the
Treasury, the disgusting coldness of his manner,
which would revolt those he ought to court, and
who foresaw (though not to the degree I found
afterwards) how little he was made to ingratiate
himself with strangers, and consequently to conduct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
the House of Commons, earnestly dissuaded him from
undertaking that post. My opinion concurring with
his own sentiments, though at first he had been
staggered, he set himself to refuse that employment
with a vehemence much beyond his natural temper.
For Secretary of State he was excellently fitted, and
no man ever applied himself to the business of his
office with such unrelaxed industry. Unluckily, the
department he refused was bestowed on Dowdeswell,
who was so suited to the drudgery of the office, as
far as it depends on arithmetic, that he was fit for
nothing else. Heavy, slow, methodical without
clearness, a butt for ridicule, unversed in every
graceful art, and a stranger to men and courts, he
was only esteemed by the few to whom he was personally
known.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
The Marquis of Rockingham was almost the reverse.
More childish in his deportment than in his
age, he was totally void of all information. Ambitious,
with excessive indolence; fond of talking of
business, but dilatory in the execution; his single
talent lay in attracting dependants: yet, though
proud and self-sufficient, he had almost as many
governors as dependants. To this unpromising disposition,
he had so weak a frame of person and
nerves, that no exigence could surmount his timidity
of speaking in public; and having been only known
to that public by his passion for horse-races, men
could not be cured of their surprise at seeing him
First Minister, as he never could give them an
opportunity of knowing whether he had any other
talents. A silent First Minister was a phenomenon
unknown since Parliaments had borne so great a
share in the revolutions of government. His personal
character was blameless—unfortunately, the
times required something more than negative qualities!<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
The most sensible step taken by the new Ministers
at their outset, was endeavouring to gain the
countenance of Mr. Pitt—at least, affecting to wear
the marks of enjoying it. One of the Vice-Treasurerships
of Ireland, vacant by Rigby’s resignation,
was offered to James Grenville, who expressed, and
I believe sincerely, his concern at not being able to
accept it. The Cofferer’s place was also tendered to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
Lord Lyttelton, who had much occasion for it, and
who no less sincerely lamented that his having been
included in the family reconciliation of the Grenvilles
forbad his joining in a system founded on the
disgrace of Mr. Grenville. But a step more material,
and more likely to impose on the world, met
with better success. This was an offer of the peerage
to Lord Chief Justice Pratt. Lord Rockingham,
whose aunt<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> was married to Lord Mansfield,
and who hoped for the assistance of the latter, was
averse to this measure, on the evident probability
that Pratt would be a troublesome rival of Mansfield
in the House of Lords. In truth, that probability
made Pratt’s peerage infinitely more important
to the nation than the court paid to Mr. Pitt by
it could be; and had the new arrangement produced
no other benefit to the country, that single step had
made the change desirable. Nothing could be more
dangerous than the influence of so arbitrary a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
as Lord Mansfield over the House of Lords, where
a lawyer of such eminent abilities was sure to preponderate;
for the Chancellor<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> was too profligate in
every light to carry any authority. Pratt, with great
thankfulness, took the title of Lord Camden.</p>

<p>Still, more weight was wanted. Charles Townshend
and Charles Yorke were applied to. Each
fluctuated according to their various degrees of
timidity and irresolution. The first seemed transported
with the change—then refused to engage—and
then would not lose his place. Thus he neither
pleased the fallen Ministers, nor satisfied his successors.
His brother,<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> whom he feared, went to the
King, declaimed against the change, yet at last
promised to support it. Charles seemed to support
it only because he had <em>not</em> promised. Yorke’s
scruples had deeper root. His ambition pointed
immediately at the Chancellor’s Seals; and finding
no hopes of them, he dreaded offending the other
party, who might recover their power and that of
making a Chancellor. These perplexities he did
not express; but at first pleaded reluctance to
come in when his friend Dr. Hay was turned out.
He next had qualms about Norton, who was not
his friend, and who now, to the universal joy of the
nation, was turned out by the new Ministers, with
the no slight dissatisfaction of Lord Bute. Charles
Yorke then consented to take the place of Attorney-General
in Norton’s room, and as quickly repented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
of and recalled his consent. However, as he
too was one who had great sway with Lord Rockingham,
and as his family inclined to the new system,
Yorke remained of their connection, and some
time after was again made Attorney-General.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> His
youngest brother<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> was preferred to the Admiralty,
and the Earl of Breadalbane, whose eldest daughter<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>
Lord Hardwicke had married, was appointed Privy
Seal of Scotland, Lord Frederick Campbell being
turned out; a half oblation to the King;—the real
reparation not being made by the restoration of
Mackenzie. Lord Lorn, who had given up his brother-in-law
Conway, was as little delicate on the disgrace
of his own brother Lord Frederick. No sooner
had the change taken place, than not resenting the
latter, and trusting that the former was not resented,
Lord Lorn wrote to Mr. Conway from Scotland
to say, that as he was so connected with the
Duke of Bedford, he could ask nothing from the
new Administration; but if the King should offer
him a regiment, he could not refuse it from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
Majesty, though he could not violate his connection
with the Bedfords. Mr. Conway could not mistake
the drift of this casuistry. The regiment was
offered, and accepted.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt’s behaviour was various and full of mystery.
When Norton was turned out, Pitt sent him
word that it was not done by his advice, and that
were he Minister, he should be glad of the assistance
of such abilities. As nobody supposed that Mr.
Pitt directed the new Administration, however good
his intentions to them might be; as he and Norton
had ever acted in an opposite line, and on opposite
principles; and as Norton had by no means been
gentle in his attacks, the message seemed uncalled
for and mean-spirited: nor was it to be accounted
for, unless in scorn of Yorke, or as an innuendo to
Lord Bute, that his friends would have received
better quarter, had the treaty with Pitt succeeded
or should succeed another time. The Duke of
Grafton and Admiral Saunders had been advised
and pressed by Pitt to promote the formation of the
new Ministry. The latter asked if he might mention
that advice? Pitt replied, “Tell it everywhere.”
Pitt then went to Stowe for a few days,
returned to town, visited Grenville, and was with
him for some time. The Duke of Grafton hearing
that in consequence of that visit Grenville had
affirmed that Mr. Pitt had to him expressed disapprobation
of the new system, the Duke wrote to
Mr. Pitt, who declared he had seen Mr. Grenville<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
but once since the new Administration had taken
place, and then not in private, and had not to him,
or to any one else, disapproved of the present
arrangement.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>There still remained some persons to be satisfied,
and more were necessary to be acquired. Lord Shelburne
was offered his old place at the head of the
Board of Trade. He declined it in a pompous letter,
in which he said he regarded measures, not
men; he would wait to see what their measures (he
should have said what their <em>success</em>) would be. The
post was conferred on the Earl of Dartmouth.
Stanley was dissatisfied with not being allowed to
keep the Admiralty with the government of the Isle
of Wight. Lord Howe, on the contrary, though
promoted by Grenville, accepted the Treasurership
of the Navy. Lord Digby,<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> to compensate to Lord
Holland for the loss of his place, was created an
English peer; but the latter had rendered himself
so obnoxious to the new Ministers by his character,
by his connection with the Favourite, and by the
persecution he had carried on against the Whigs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
that they who consulted their own characters, and
indulged their resentments beyond what prudence
dictated, totally neglected him. Nor could the
Duke of Cumberland or House of Cavendish forgive
him. Lord Strange chose to preserve his employment,
and pleaded having bargained with the late
Ministers that his place should not affect his conduct
in Parliament. There was another man who
was early in the most humble application to the
Duke of Cumberland to be received into the new
establishment; this was Lord George Sackville.
He did not ask, he said, for anything in the military
line. The Duke was disposed to give him hopes
only; but, by more judicious addresses to Lord
Rockingham, Lord George was not long before he
obtained one of the lucrative Vice-Treasurerships of
Ireland.</p>

<p>There was much more difficulty about the Duke
of Richmond. He had entirely broken with the
late Ministers, and attached himself to the Duke of
Cumberland. The arrangement, however, had been
made without any suitable provision for his Grace.
At last he was offered the place of Cofferer. He
said modestly that he knew he had not the same
pretensions to the first posts as the other young
noblemen of his own rank, since he had not suffered
like them, had not engaged with them in opposition,
and consequently had not the same merit with
the party. He owned, however, that he wished for
an active place in business. I persuaded him not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
to accept Cofferer, and assured him I would not rest
till I saw him placed in a situation suitable to his
rank and talents. I kept my word; and as the
Duke of Cumberland had dropped a hint of making
Lord Hertford Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and of
sending the Duke Ambassador to Paris, I pursued
that idea, though the Duke wished rather to be employed
at home; till, on Lord Hertford’s nomination
to Ireland, I pushed Mr. Conway so warmly that
he obtained the embassy for the Duke of Richmond.
Mr. Conway had had more difficulty in succeeding
for Lord Hertford, whose conduct, in not taking
part with his brother and his wife’s nephew, the
Duke of Grafton, had given universal disgust to the
party. Richmond was indeed the only steady acquisition
the Ministers made. Yet the intemperance
of the disgraced Cabal threw another important
convert into their hands. Grenville told Lord
Granby that the new Ministers had wished to turn
out his father, the Duke of Rutland, in order to
save the Duke of Marlborough. Lord Granby was
advised to ask the King if this was true. The King
denied it; and in that conversation made such impression
on that light man, that, with the addition
of the first vacant regiment for his uncle, Lord
Robert Manners, Lord Granby was entirely gained
over from his late allies. This blow was sensibly
felt by Grenville, who was not endowed with the
spirit of patience. His behaviour on his fall was
abject and full of lamentation; and, as disgraced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
Ministers are seldom pitied, so the occasion generally
calls forth even those spots that flattery had
concealed from the prying eyes of opposition. The
vaunted economy of this Minister had not been
restrained to the public service. It now came out
that he had obtained the reversion of one of the
lighthouses<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> for himself under another name; and
that, having bestowed an inferior office in the Treasury
on his cook, he had bid the man expect no
wages for five years. Lord Halifax had been guilty
of worse corruption: he and his mistress had sold
every employment in his gift.</p>

<p>But if the integrity of the new Ministers shone
by the comparison with their predecessors, in want
of prudence they seemed to have taken the example
of those very predecessors for the rule of
their own conduct. Nothing could induce them to
take the smallest step that might secure favour in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
the closet, by even civility to the Favourite. Perhaps
the disguise used by the King deceived them
into an idea of that attention not being necessary.
He told them early that he understood their bargain,
and that Lord Bute should not meddle; and
that if Elliot and Oswald would not work (support
them by speaking in Parliament) he gave them
power to turn out both. The conduct of the Ministers,
as individuals, was honourable—but in not
restoring Mackenzie, unjust both to the King and the
sufferer, and too great a sacrifice to popularity. I
pressed the restitution of Mackenzie to Mr. Conway,
and urged that, as public men and friends to their
country, it behoved them to bend a little in order
to secure their power in exclusion to men of worse
designs. But to talk to Conway against public
opinion was preaching to the winds. Even Lord
Northumberland, from his relation to the Favourite,
was neglected in the new system, though he had
been deprived of the government of Ireland by the
late Cabal on the same foundation.</p>

<p>The Princess of Wales was the first offended on
finding she could promise herself as little influence
over the new Ministers as of late she had experienced
from the last. A conversation was much
talked of, in which it was said warm words were
overheard between her and her son, who was distinctly
heard (according to the report) to tell her,
that <em>he had ventured his crown to obey her</em>. The disgusts
of Lord Bute’s friends, and of the late Ministers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
whose rupture had its origin in the animosities
between the Princess and the Duchess of Bedford,
gave occasion to an excellent <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon mot</i> of George
Selwyn, who said of the two factions, <em>that, like thieves
going to execution, they laid their ruin to lewd women</em>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their sacrifices to popularity,
and with self-created omens that promised them
little stability, the first public notice taken of the
new Ministers gave them no reason to think that
there was a general approbation of their advancement.
In the Address of the City of London on the
birth of a Prince, the King was told that when his
measures should be established, that great body
would be ready to support them. The Ex-ministers
took this as a compliment to themselves; but
it more probably had reference to Mr. Pitt, the idol
of the citizens.</p>

<p>Abroad the change was no sooner known, than
Prince Ferdinand wrote to Mr. Conway to propose
coming over with the Hereditary Prince, or afterwards,
and begged Mr. Conway to tell him in confidence
whether the King would like it. The King
said he should like it much, but that Prince Ferdinand
had better wait till his nephew was gone
back again to Germany, because the latter, having
married a Princess of England, must be distinguished
by ceremonial. Whoever remembered how little
distinction had been paid to the Prince, even on his
marriage, could not believe this to be the true reason
of the King’s waiving the visit. It was more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
natural to think his Majesty was not eager to be
witness of Prince Ferdinand’s popularity, when his
own was at so low an ebb; nor could he wish that
his new Ministers should enjoy the triumph and advantages
of a visit that seemed paid to them rather
than to himself. Whatever hindered it, Prince
Ferdinand never came. The Prince and Princess
of Brunswick did arrive by particular invitation.
Some thought Lord Bute hoped to engage Mr. Pitt
by the intervention of the Hereditary Prince; but
the court paid of late, both by the Prince and his
wife, to the Princess Dowager, had entirely won her
affections, and removed her antipathy to the House
of Brunswick.</p>

<p>The dissolution of our Opposition now afforded
me that opportunity of retreating from those who
had composed it, for which I had so eagerly longed;
nor was I dilatory in executing my resolution.
Many new reasons concurred to make me adhere to
the plan I had formed. It was against my opinion
that my friends had accepted the Administration;
and though I would not peremptorily advise Mr.
Conway to decline taking part, when he told
me he thought himself obliged in honour to obey
the King’s and Duke’s commands, still I saw so
much weakness both in the leaders and the numbers,
that I entertained no hopes of the permanence
of their power. Chiefs who could not conduct a
party with sense, seemed little qualified to govern a
nation. I had given notice, that if ever they attained
power, I would have nothing farther to do
with them. They had attained it now, but with so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
little prospect of maintaining their ground, that
nothing was so probable as their being soon driven
to opposition again. In that I was determined to
engage with them no more. If I quitted them triumphant,
they would have no right to call on me
should they again be defeated by their own want of
skill. I had fully satisfied my honour and my engagements,
and had anybody cause to complain, it
was myself—but I chose to part with them on good
terms; nor would I, when I was really hurt, condescend
to utter a reproach. This topic truth demands
that I should explain. I had entered into
opposition on the view of the violent measures, and
still more violent designs of the Court. Personal
dislike to the Bedford faction had inflamed my
natural warmth, and the oppression exercised on
Mr. Conway had fixed in me an unalterable desire
of overturning that Administration. Not the
smallest view of self-interest had entered into my
imagination. On the contrary I risked an easy
ample fortune with which I was thoroughly contented.
When I found unjust power exerted to
wrong me, I am not ashamed to say I flattered
myself that, if ever our party was successful, I
should obtain to have the payments of my place
settled on some foundation that should not expose
me to the caprice or wanton tyranny of every succeeding
Minister; for court I was resolved to make
to none, whether friend or foe,—a haughtiness I
maintained throughout my life, never once condescending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
to go to the levee of any first Minister.
My wish of making this independence perfectly
easy I had hinted to Mr. Conway during our opposition.
He received it with silence. It was not in
my nature to repeat such a hint. As disinterestedness
was my ruling passion, I did hope that on the
change some considerable employment would be
offered to me, which my vanity would have been
gratified in refusing. It was mortifying enough to
me, when Mr. Conway (for I have said that during
the last negotiation I was confined in bed with the
gout) reported to me the proposed arrangement of
places, to find that my name had not been so much
as mentioned. That I would take no place was
well known,—I had frequently declared it. From
the Duke of Cumberland, to whom I had never
paid court; from the Duke of Newcastle, whom I
had constantly ridiculed; from Lord Rockingham
and the Cavendishes, whom I had treated with a
very moderate share of regard; I had no reason to
expect much attention: and though some notice is
due to all men who are respected in a party, <em>they</em>
were excusable in proposing nothing for me, when
they found nothing demanded for me by my own
intimate friend and near relation. He must be
supposed to know my mind best: if he was silent,
what called on them to be more solicitous for my
interest? But what could excuse this neglect in
Mr. Conway? For him I had sacrificed everything;
for him I had been injured, oppressed, calumniated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
The foundation of his own fortune, and almost
every step of his fortune, he owed solely to me.
How thoroughly soever he knew my sentiments,
was a compliment at least not due to me. Whatever
was due to me, much or little, he totally forgot
it; and so far from once endeavouring to secure my
independence, in his whole life after he never once
mentioned it. I had too much spirit to remind him
of it, though he has since frequently vaunted to me
his own independence. Such failure of friendship,
or to call it by its truer name, such insensibility,
could not but shock a heart at once so tender and
so proud as mine. His ensuing conduct completely
opened my eyes. When I saw him eager and
anxious to exalt his brother Hertford to the Vice-royalty
of Ireland, and his brother-in-law Lorn to
a regiment; and when he omitted no occasion of
serving them and the Duke of Argyle<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> and Lord
Frederick Campbell—all four, men who had abandoned
him to persecution without a pang, I saw
clearly into his nature. He thought it noble, he
thought it would be fame, to pardon the neglect he
had met with; and that the world would applaud
his generous return of their ungenerous and interested
behaviour. No glory would have accrued
from his serving me, as it would have been natural
and no more than was expected. His heart was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
cold that it wanted all the beams of popular applause
to kindle it into action. I had command
enough of myself not to drop a word of reproach on
a friendship so frozen; but, without murmur, and
with my wonted cheerfulness, as soon as my strength
was tolerably recruited, I declared my intention of
making a visit to Lord Hertford, at Paris, before he
quitted his embassy. I acted with the same unconcern
to the whole party, for I would neither suffer
them nor my enemies to know that I had any cause
to be dissatisfied with Mr. Conway. When I
scorned to open myself, even to him, it was not
likely I should be more communicative to others.
As disgust with my friends did not, as most commonly
happens, reconcile me to my enemies, I foresaw
that I might still have occasion to make use of
my power with Mr. Conway to the annoyance of
the latter; for though Mr. Conway had none of the
warmth of friendship, yet he had more confidence
in me, and knew he might have, than in any man
living; and, notwithstanding the indifference I have
described, he frequently trusted me afterwards with
secrets that he reserved from his wife and his
brother.</p>

<p>He no sooner discovered that my intention was to
remain in France much longer than he expected, than
he broke out into complaints, entreaties, and reproaches:
and, as if he had satisfied all the duties of
friendship, and I had violated them, he tried with
angry words to divert me from my purpose; urged the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
occasion he should have for my advice, and called my
retreat desertion of my friends. Satisfied with making
him feel the want of me, and now hardened
against the calls of friendship, I treated the matter
lightly, civilly, and desultorily. I reminded him of the
declaration I had often made of quitting the party as
soon as they should be successful, which he could
not deny; and, with a little mixture of conscious
scorn, I said I knew the obligations the party had
had to me; I knew none I had to them. Vexed,
and his pride hurt, he employed Lady Ailesbury to
tell me in his presence that he looked upon my
behaviour as deserting him; and himself dropped
many peevish accents. Fixed in the plan I had
laid down to myself, nothing could provoke me to
be serious; I carried off all with good humour; and,
above owing to a retort of reproaches what I ought
to have owed to his sentiments, I parted with him
with such inflexible, and consequently mysterious,
cheerfulness, that he knew not what interpretation
to put on my behaviour—if he did guess, he was
more blameable than I suspected. His insensibility
had made me insensible; his ingratitude would have
given me stronger sensations. But it is justice to
him to say, that I think he was incapable of ingratitude:
his soul was good, virtuous, sincere; but his
temper was chill, his mind absent; and he was so
accustomed to my suggesting to him whatever I
thought it was right for him to do, that he had no
notion of my concealing a thought from him; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
as I had too much delicacy to mention even my
own security, I am persuaded it never came into his
conception. His temper hurt me, but I forgave his
virtue, of which I am confident, and know it was
superior to my own. We have continued to this
day on an easy and confidential footing; but conscious
that I would not again devote myself for him,
I have taken strict care never to give him decisive
advice, when it might lead him to a precipice. Before
I set out, and as a mark that I meant no breach
with him, at the same time to serve another friend,
and to wear an air of interest with the Administration
which might disguise my dissatisfaction, I desired
Mr. Conway to raise Sir Horace Mann, the resident
at Florence, to the rank of envoy; which was
immediately done. The Bedfords, however, knew
me enough to surmise that my retreat was the effect
of some dislike I had conceived to the new system;
and at my return to England, near eight months
afterwards, officiously threw out civilities that might
draw me to their connection. I soon let them see
that whatever my dislikes were, nothing had happened
to soften my conduct, or change my opinion
of them and their principles. Nor was it much
longer before they found that I had lost neither
inclination nor power to bar their return to Court
by the weight I retained with Mr. Conway.</p>

<p>I left England in August, and did not return
till the April following. A very interesting scene
passed in the interval, on which, as I was not an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
eye-witness, I shall be more brief than ordinary;
but as I corresponded with Mr. Conway, was consulted
by him, and received other information from
very good authority, I shall set down nothing but
what I know to be truth; and that will be sufficient
not to leave any material break in the thread of my
narration.</p>

<p>The new Ministers had scarce taken possession of
their places, before they were alarmed with accounts
of the mutinous behaviour of the Colonies, on the
attempt to carry into execution the new Stamp Act.
The Americans were determined not to submit to
it; and great pains had been taken in order to bring
about a general union of all the provinces, in order
to oppose the admission of the tax. To all it
was disagreeable; yet some Colonies accepted it.
Virginia and New England were the most refractory,
and precipitated themselves into great violences.
In some parts, the ships that brought over
the stamps were seized and the stamps burned. The
officers of the new revenue were not suffered to
land, or were cruelly treated, their houses forced
and pillaged, and their persons menaced. The
governors themselves were not secure, and trembled
lest their few strongholds should be seized by the
hand of rebellion. In the most mutinous towns
there was no possibility of executing the Act. But
the weapon with which the Colonies armed themselves
to most advantage, was the refusal of paying
the debts they owed to our merchants at home, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
goods and wares exported to the American provinces.
These debts involved the merchants of
London, Liverpool, Manchester, and other great
trading towns, in a common cause with the Americans,
who forswore all traffic with us, unless the
obnoxious Stamp Act was repealed. Nothing could
be more delicate to the new Ministers than such
a crisis. They themselves had opposed the Act.
Should they enforce the execution, which could
only be done by the sword, it would be tyrannizing
against their consciences, and supporting a bad or
weak act of their antagonists. They would risk
lighting up a rebellion in the Colonies, would ruin
the mutual intercourse and trade between the
mother-country and the outlying provinces; would
endanger those distant dominions flinging themselves
into the arms of France or Spain, at least receiving
succours thence; while they were threatened at the
same time with insurrections in the trading towns
at home, who loudly demanded a repeal of the bill,
on which depended the payment of what was due to
them, and the hopes of re-establishing so beneficial
a commerce.</p>

<p>On the other hand, to repeal a revenue-bill, because
it was distasted by those obnoxious to it, was
setting a precedent of the most fatal complexion.
What country, what town, what profession, what
order of men, would submit to the most legal impositions,
if Government once showed itself afraid, and
recoiled, as soon as force was used to reject the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
duty? In the present case the insult was unparalleled
and accompanied with every kind of aggravating
circumstance. Not only payment of the
duty was refused, but the very authority called in
question by which it was enjoined. The Parliament
of Great Britain, said the Colonists, had no right to
impose internal taxes on them: they were not represented
there; they would tax themselves. This
was striking at the very vitals of the Constitution,
for however the Colonies affected to distinguish
between the King and the Parliament, the Act had
been the act of the whole Legislature, and the Constitution
knows not the King in a legislative capacity
distinct from the two other branches of the
Legislature. Here was disobedience to the law, and
rebellion against the principle of all our laws. Nor
was this speculative view the sole object to weigh in
the decision the Ministers were to make. Should
they embrace the measure of repeal, were they sure
they could carry it? The Act had passed by a great
majority in both Houses, and with the royal assent.
Was it probable that such majorities could be induced
to revoke their opinion in compliment to
mutinous associations that flew in the face of their
ordinance, and denied their authority? Was it
likely that the King would approve of, or consent
to, such diminution of his Majesty, before an attempt
had been made to enforce it? When do
princes bend but after a defeat? There could be no
doubt but force would easily reduce the Colonies to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
obedience. They had no strongholds, were ill-armed,
a disjointed body, not yet engaged in a common
cause, nor so compact a corps as easily to be
put in motion together; and from being distinct
governments, habituated to different usages, and actuated
by different interests, easily to be separated
from a joint plan, and more likely to obstruct than
to promote one general system of operations. To
temporize in favour of resisting subjects would be
speaking that language of Whiggism so distasteful
to the Court, so dissonant from the tone of the
present reign, and so much objected to the new
Ministers during the late opposition. It would be
opening a door to the flattery of their antagonists,
who, instead of setting out by obstructing the measures
of the Crown, would have an opportunity of
paying their court at the expense of the Ministers
themselves.</p>

<p>These were deep and weighty considerations, and,
with this precipice on either hand, were young, artless,
inexperienced men to date their career. Grenville,
the parent of the Bill, and even fond of it
beyond the love of a politician, was not a man to
overlook so sudden a prospect of recovering the
ground he had lost. Though he would have revelled
in an opportunity of glutting his vengeance
and enforcing obedience to his law, he could not
but enjoy the distress to which the crisis reduced
his adversaries. It suited his proud spirit to call
for assertion of the Crown’s and Parliament’s dignity;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
and his revengeful spirit, to drive the Ministers
on measures so repugnant to their principles
and opinions, and, rather than not see the Colonies
punished, he wished to have the punishment inflicted
even by his adversaries. He toiled to obtain
the most circumstantial evidence of the mutiny;
he exaggerated every instance, and called aloud on
the hand of power to vindicate the honour of the
Legislature.</p>

<p>As the accounts from America grew every day
worse, the Ministers, who at first were inclined to
repeal the Act, were borne down by the flagrancy
of the provocation. But being temperate men in
themselves, fixed in their principles, forseeing not
only more extensive but more immediate evils from
violence, (for the danger from the clamours of the
merchants and trading towns increased in proportion,)
and possibly indignant at the attempts made
by their antagonists to drive them to extremities,
they coolly and firmly resolved to remove the grievance,
rather than involve their country and outlying
brethren in a series of calamities more destructive
of the common good than the wound given to the
authority of Government. Whoever will reflect on
the state of the dangers they were to encounter, and
which I have specified above, must own that their
conduct was virtuous, honest, prudent, humane, and
brave: it will be difficult, I believe, to discover that
it could be interested.</p>

<p>This determination of the Ministers to attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
the repeal of the Stamp Act was putting their power
to the test at once; and was the more adventurous,
as they certainly had not taken any steps to secure
the previous favour of the Crown. If on one hand
they increased by this measure the animosity of
Grenville and his party, and held out to him the
means of making his cause common with that of the
Legislature; on the other, they afforded an opportunity
to Lord Bute and his faction of returning
their hostilities, and of veiling his grievances under
the mantle of the King’s and Parliament’s dignity.
The Colonies, however pleased, could lend no support
to their protectors, who, in truth, could stand
on no ground at home, but on the popularity they
had already acquired with the people, and should
acquire with the mercantile part of the kingdom.
In this exigence they lost the only real pillar of
their Administration at Court.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the services he had rendered, it
is not probable that the Duke of Cumberland had
made any progress in his Majesty’s or the Princess’s
affections. He had driven out obnoxious Ministers,
it is true, and furnished the King with a new set
when no others would venture to enlist. But were
not these new men more attached to his Royal
Highness than to the person of the King? and had
not the Duke promoted his own views in forming an
Administration for his nephew? Had his Royal
Highness interested himself to obtain any terms for
the Favourite? Was not the latter in a manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
proscribed by the friends of his Royal Highness?
Had not the most select of those friends been as
offensive to the Princess as the late Ministers themselves?
Undoubtedly; and yet the personal character
of his Royal Highness was in such estimation,
his behaviour was so full of dignity, he was so
attached to the Crown, and understood the Court
so much better than the Ministers, and could dare
to hazard language in the closet which their want
of authority and favour forbad them to use, that
he could have interposed in their behalf, or could
have bent them to necessary submission to the
Crown, which no other man in England was capable
of doing. But of this mediator the Ministers were
soon deprived.</p>

<p>On the 30th of October his Royal Highness was
playing at picquet with General Hodgson.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> He
grew confused, and mistook the cards. The next
day he was recovered enough to appear at Court;
but after dinner was seized with a suffocation, and
ordered the window to be opened. One of his
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">valets-de-chambre</i>, who was accustomed to bleed him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
was called, and prepared to tie up his arm; but the
Duke said, “It is too late!—it is all over!”—and
expired.</p>

<p>I have spoken so much of his Royal Highness’s
character in the beginning and in various parts of
these Memoirs,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> that little addition is necessary.
His haughtiness and severity had made him most
obnoxious in the early parts of his life. His profound
understanding had taught him to profit of his
mortifications; and though he never condescended
to make himself amiable but to very few, he became
as much respected, though deprived of power,
as if his heroism had been victorious. Whether
his good sense would have resisted prosperity with
equal temper, I much doubt. He would have made
a great King, but probably too great a King for so
corrupt a Country. His indifference to death, which
he had so long and so frequently had in prospect in
the last years of his life, and which he seemed to
invite, was, I believe, less owing to the solidity of
his courage, which was intrepid, than to the unhappiness
of his situation. His bodily infirmities,<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
though borne without complaint or impatience,
were grievous. His mind had been more sensibly
afflicted. Born with a martial spirit and fond of
command, he had not only been unsuccessful in
every battle, except that of Culloden; but had been
forced by cruel circumstances from the favourite
profession of his soul; in civil life he was kept, by
the temper of his father and the aversion of the
Princess Dowager, in a state of neglect and disgrace.
Fox, who he had a right to expect should
stickle for his power, had betrayed and abandoned
him; Pitt had made it a point to bar him from all
influence; and the two Pelhams, after leaning on
him for a while, had sacrificed him to the Princess
and to their own ambition or jealousy of credit.
His mind had not been formed for idleness, and
could ill digest an exclusion from all military and all
civil councils; and was too lofty and too unpliant to
feed on trifling amusements. It had the great, but
none of the little, powers of philosophy; could bear
misfortune, but could not compensate to itself for
the want of its object. He used books rather than
liked or valued them, and cared for none of the
arts. His principles restrained him from going
any considerable lengths against the Crown; nor
could he stoop to bestow those caresses that are
necessary to form extensive connections. He dealt
his smiles to those who followed him, like a King
that rewards, not like the head of a party, who has
farther to go. The dignity of his conduct and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
behaviour gave his Court the air of a dethroned
monarch’s, but had nothing of a Prince whom his
nephew’s Court had suspected of having views on
the Crown.</p>

<p>The King, at his Royal Highness’s request, had
promised the first vacant garter to the Earl of
Albemarle,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> and now with great propriety bestowed
on him that of his master. The Ministers,
too, were assured by his Majesty that the Duke’s
death should make no alteration in the present
system.</p>

<p>In London, the Duke’s death was deeply felt; and
when the orders for mourning were issued, which,
according to usage, were as for an uncle, and regulated
by the late shorter ceremonial, the middling
and lower people almost universally went into the
closet mourning with weepers, and wore it for the
whole time that had been customary before the
contraction enjoined in the late reign. An attempt
was made for a subscription to raise a statue to his
memory, but without success:<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> and the new area<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
in Berkeley Square being destined for the place,
Adam,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> a Scotch architect, defeated the project, from
the hatred which his nation bore to their conqueror,
by proposing to erect a statue<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> of his Majesty on
that very spot, a compliment his Majesty too willingly
accepted, and which became ridiculous by the
King himself being at the expense. The Duchess
of Bedford, then at Bath, distinguished her animosity
as absurdly, by wearing slighter mourning
for the Duke than that prescribed by the Court.</p>

<p>The Administration was not without difficulties
with regard to the Courts of Versailles and Madrid,
who delayed to demolish the fortifications of
Dunkirk, to liquidate the payment on the Canada
Bills, and to settle the ransom of the Manillas.
But though the new Ministers were more in earnest
in their attempts to obtain all these ends than their
predecessors had been, the ignominy of not obtaining
them lay heavier on the latter. They it
was who had sacrificed so much glory and advantage
to the two Courts—at least all of them had
concurred with Lord Bute in that paltry Peace;
and when they had retained so small a portion
of our conquests, and stipulated for such slight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
indemnifications, on them it lay to have secured
at least the accomplishment of such poor terms.
Indeed they had not dared to use a vigorous tone
to either Court; for could the Ministers of Louis
or Charles believe that those men would seriously
undertake a war for trifles, who had sacrificed so
much to purchase a Peace that they might have
dictated? They accordingly had hoped that they
should wheedle the two Courts to save them from
the reproach of having accepted fallacious conditions,
rather than attempted to call loudly for execution
of the Treaty. The new Ministers had less to fear
in speaking out. They had nothing to manage for
their own sakes; and if the nation was not in a
situation or a temper to go to war for the violation
of the Peace, they were not answerable for the
measures that had reduced us to such a state of
timidity. It would be glorious to them to extort
what the peacemakers had not dared to insist on;
or baffled, the shame would lie at the door of their
predecessors. Our Ministers, therefore, at Versailles
and Madrid were ordered to make the demands
with spirit. The Duke of Richmond, though
he had concurred in the Peace, wanted no alacrity
to enforce the terms of it. He had had little or
no connection with the late Administration, had
never been favourably looked on at Court, had no
predilection for Lord Bute, and now entered with
warmth into alliance with the Ministers. Though
possessed of the Dukedom of Aubigné, he was far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
from having any partiality to France: and having
naturally a high and national spirit, he was ready
to hold as firm a language as the Administration
could choose to authorize. In truth, his friends
apprehended that he would be more likely to embroil
the Courts than to relax in following his
instructions. Yet young, inexperienced, and high-souled
as he was, no man could conduct himself
with more prudence and temper. Though he negotiated
with obstinacy, he bore the flippancy and
evasions of the Duc de Choiseul with admirable
patience, neither betraying the honour of the Crown,
nor exposing it to any unwarrantable contestations.
In the short period of his embassy he performed
an essential service by his resolution, quickness,
industry, and perseverance. It is almost sufficient
to say, that he settled one point of his negotiation
and was unwelcome to that Court: a proof
that he neither temporized too far, nor was over-reached
by men of larger experience. On his way
to Paris he passed purposely by Dunkirk. The
Duke of Cumberland had disapproved of that visit.
“My Lord,” said the Prince, “Dunkirk is not
worth going to war for: if you do not visit it, you
may say it is destroyed; you cannot after seeing
it with your own eyes.” This implied that his
Royal Highness was convinced France did not
mean to destroy it. As I had arrived at Paris
before the Duke of Richmond, I had learnt the
desperate situation of their finances, and was witness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
to the disturbances occasioned to their Government
by the active spirit of their Parliaments.
I had written to Mr. Conway on these grounds,
to advise their authorizing the Duke to talk big
to the French Court, who, from the causes I have
mentioned, were less in a situation than we were
to recommence war. Mr. Conway heartily approved
my views. The Duke had more doubts,
but yielded to my reasons when he came over and
found the soundness of my intelligence. The measure
succeeded to my expectation. The Duc de
Choiseul consented at last to settle the affair of
the Canada Bills. Our merchants at home had
blundered in their calculation, and asked less for
themselves than they were entitled to. Sir John
Lambert,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> an English banker at Paris, pointed out
the error to the Duke, who, with amazing quickness,
himself discovered a method of obtaining,
within twelve thousand pounds, a full indemnification
for them. The French Court yielded to
this new demand.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> I persuaded the Duke to conclude
the negotiation without any new transaction
with our merchants at home, lest the readiness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
the French should cool; and I urged him to ratify
the agreement on the authority of three letters
from Mr. Conway, who pressed to finish the bargain,
and enjoined him to threaten the French
Ministers that he (Conway) would represent it to
Parliament, if they did not do us justice. The
Duke doubted whether, having put the business
into a new train, he could justify concluding it without
again consulting the merchants. I persuaded
him to despatch a courier to Mr. Conway, to say
he would conclude, but not to specify in his public
letter the error of the merchants, lest the Court of
France should get intelligence, and repent of their
facility.</p>

<p>With regard to Dunkirk, nothing was to be obtained.
Choiseul told the Duke of Richmond that
the late Ministers had not been so difficult. “But,”
said the Duke, “before I came away, I saw in the
Secretary’s office a strong letter to your Court on
the subject of Dunkirk.” “True,” said Choiseul,
“but it was not written till after Lord Halifax
knew he was to be turned out.” This indiscretion
flowed from Choiseul’s natural levity, not from any
intention of hurting our late Ministers, whose fall
he regretted, and on whose complaisance<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
better build than on men who had loudly condemned
the Peace. Still was France not alarmed
while Mr. Pitt remained without power. Their
dread of him existed in all its force. To judge of
it, one should have seen, as I did, the efficacy of his
name to change their countenances and language.
One day at dinner with the Duc de Praslin, when
Mr. Pitt was accidentally mentioned, the Duc, with
visible marks of alarm, asked if Mr. Pitt was coming
into place again? And it is true that when any
Frenchman gave a loose to their natural presumption
before me, I had no occasion but to drop a careless
hint that he was likely to be again employed,
to strike silence through a whole company.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></p>

<p>One other point obtained by the new Ministers
was a mutual exchange of envoys between England
and Prussia, their first intercourse of communication
since the war. Mitchell, destined for that embassy,
was created a Knight of the Bath.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> Count
Malzahn came hither from Prussia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
November the 5th, Lord Camden, Chief Justice
of the Common Pleas, decided in that court the
great cause between Wilkes and the Secretaries of
State, in favour of the former.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></p>

<p>Terrick, Bishop of London, set himself to prosecute
mass-houses, with what view I know not; for
though noways blameable in his morals, zeal for religion
by no means entered into the composition
of the man. Ambition, creeping upwards by little
intrigues, formed his whole character. Perhaps he
thought this activity might be one step to the primacy.
He had not much chance under the new
dispensation.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> The Duke of Newcastle, whose fears
had surmounted his passion for the first rank in
power, had told the King that he would content
himself with making bishops in concert with the
archbishop. Content or not, he had waived the
Treasury, and Lord Rockingham, become First
Minister by accepting it, was too fond of power not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
to engross all he could. It was a proof how old
Newcastle was grown, when he bore this pre-eminence
without jealousy or treachery.</p>

<p>Lord Rockingham had been advised, seeing the
present Parliament had been chosen by Lord Bute,
and recruited by Grenville, not to trust to it, but to
dissolve, and call a new one; and that measure was
for some time in deliberation. For his own interest
he would have acted wisely, no doubt, in taking the
advice; but he at last rejected the proposal, saying,
that in so factious a time it would produce unheard
of corruption. The sentiment was laudable, but
neither faction nor corruption has decreased since
that time.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

youngest brother.—Walpole’s Observations upon the state of
France at this period.—Death of the Dauphin.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 17th of December the Parliament met.
Grenville, apprized of the intention to repeal the
Stamp Act, had laboured to form a strong Opposition,
giving out that the Ministers were going to
rescind all his acts, because his. The very first day
of the session he proposed to address the Crown, to
know how the Stamp Act had been enforced; and
in amendment of the address, proposed to insert the
word <em>rebellious</em> in speaking of the Colonies.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> He
professed great readiness to congratulate his Majesty
on the birth of a young Prince. With regard
to the Duke of Cumberland’s death, he would not,
he said, flatter dead whom he had never flattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
living. He was answered by Elliot, Lord George
Sackville, and Norton, who, though dismissed,
showed he had not imputed his disgrace to the
Crown; and whatever the intentions of the Crown
might be, it was thought proper that a majority
should first be secured, lest the Cabinet should
again be taken by storm. Charles Townshend
spoke for the Ministry,<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> with great encomiums on
Conway. Grenville finding so little countenance,
withdrew his motion.</p>

<p>In the other House, Lord Suffolk moved for an
assurance to the King that the Lords would support
his Majesty and the Parliament against the Colonies.
He was supported by the Duke of Bedford, the
Lords Gower, Halifax, Sandwich, and Temple. The
last declared there was no truth in the reports
spread of differences between him and Mr. Pitt;
they agreed on every point. The first assertion was
false; the latter soon proved to be so. Lord Shelburne
spoke for the Ministers, though his friend
Colonel Barré had declined their offers.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
concurrence of Shelburne and the retiring of Lord
Camden spoke sufficiently, that they knew or suspected
Mr. Pitt would take part for the repeal.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>
The Chancellor, Lord Pomfret, and the Duke of
Grafton opposed the motion. Lord Mansfield, in a
timid trimming speech, besought the Ministers to
agree to the motion, and retired. The question was
rejected by 80 to 24, though the new Opposition
had flattered themselves that in the House of Lords
lay their greatest strength. But they were sorely
disappointed of Lord Bute’s support, which they
expected on all the questions relative to America.</p>

<p>Two days after the former motion, the Duke of
Bedford moved for all papers that had been sent to
America relating to the Stamp Act, and since the
passing of it. The Duke of Grafton quashed that
proposal, by promising <em>all</em> the papers should be produced.
Rigby moved the same question in the
Commons, and was severely treated by Beckford,
and the motion was rejected, the Duke of Grafton
forgetting to acquaint the Ministers in that House
that he had granted the demand to the Lords. This
obliged the King to send the papers to the House of
Commons likewise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
Grenville, the next day, by surprise, proposed that
the House should adjourn, but to the 9th instead of
the 14th as the Ministers intended, in consideration
of the urgent affairs of America—as if five days
could make any difference. But the motion was
rejected by 77 to 35: so ductile and subservient to
present power was that assembly! Alderman Baker
called Grenville’s an insolent motion: being called
to order, he was silent for some minutes; and then
said, he had been trying to find another word—if
the House could, he desired them to supply it. Then
treating Grenville as the author of all the troubles
in America, the latter threw the blame from himself
on the Parliament.</p>

<p>Lord Temple, disheartened at so unpromising an
outset of the session, had the confidence and meanness
to hurry to Mr. Pitt at Bath; and now stooped
to solicit the assistance of him whom he had so
lately traversed, and whose offers he had so haughtily
rejected. Mr. Pitt in his turn was inflexible.</p>

<p>On the 29th of December, died the King’s youngest
brother, Prince Frederick, an amiable youth, and
the most promising, it was thought, of the family.
The hereditary disorder in his blood had fallen on
his lungs and turned to a consumption.</p>

<p>I will close the account of this remarkable year
with a few observations I made in France.</p>

<p>Louis the Fifteenth did not want sense, and had
as much humanity as was consistent with insensibility
and indolence. The first prevented him from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
suspecting evils that did not immediately fall under
his eye; and the latter from inquiring what oppressions
his people suffered. He was more shy than
reserved, and all these qualities tended to make him
the slave of habit. He hated new faces rather than
loved old servants. Being free from ambition, having
no appetite for glory of any kind, and impressed
with sentiments of devotion, he preferred peace, and
listened to any overtures of treaty, whether victorious
or vanquished. To the Queen he had been
for many years strictly constant; was always a civil
husband, and, in her last illness, a tender one. To
his children he was most affectionate.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> To his
mistresses profuse, but capable of harshness whenever
he quitted them. Cardinal Fleury governed
him with unbounded authority. Madame de Pompadour,
by art, and at last by complaisance in procuring
other women for him, engrossed him entirely,
but with no hold on his affections, for her death
made not the slightest impression on him.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> The Duc
de Choiseul having been placed by her, succeeded to
the ascendant that habit gives, and thence excluded
other favourites, rather than became one himself.
The King’s life was regulated by the most mechanic
sameness. An hour or two he could not deny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
to his Ministers: hunting took up the rest of daylight.
Women amused his private hours: cards and
a supper, with a select company, concluded the
evening. All the flattery of that vain and obsequious
nation, who love themselves in their kings, gave
him no pleasure. It was a negative kind of nature
that could neither be totally spoiled nor amended.
But the true picture of him was an anecdote, that I
learned from good authority. A sensible confident
of Cardinal Fleury reproached him with not making
the King apply to business. This was the answer of
that wise Minister: “I have often endeavoured
what you recommend; and one day went so far as
to tell the King that there had been kings dethroned
in France for their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fainéantise</i>.” It seemed
to strike him deeply. He made no reply: but two
days afterwards said to me, “I have been reflecting
on what you told me of some of my predecessors
being deposed—pray resolve me: when the nation
deposed them, were they allotted large pensions?”
“From that moment,” said the Cardinal, “I saw it
was in vain to labour at making him a great King.”</p>

<p>The Queen was not only a pious but a good
woman. Indifferent to the gallantries of her husband,
and free from ambition, she lived well with
him, his mistresses, and ministers. Fond of talking
and universally obliging, the nation thought
her void of any particular attachment; yet she
showed an unalterable friendship to the Duchess de
Luynes: and her affection to her father, King Stanislas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
and the loss of her son the Dauphin undoubtedly
hastened her death. Though she could
not prevent the expulsion of the Jesuits, the King’s
esteem for her mitigated their fall. It was to the
honour of both that, though the daughters of Stanislas
and Augustus, the Queen and the Dauphiness
lived in uninterrupted harmony.</p>

<p>The Dauphin, who died while I was in France,
was totally unknown till his death. His great caution
of not giving jealousy to his father, and his
respectable fear of not alarming the bigotry of his
mother and wife, had made him conceal both his
good sense and the freedom of his sentiments with
such care, that the former was not suspected; and
the latter was so unknown, that the nation, now
running with their usual vehemence into any new
opinion, and, consequently, growing Freethinkers,
believed and hated him as an enthusiast. Yet he had
a good understanding, had carefully, though secretly,
cultivated it, and was a modern philosopher in the
largest sense of that term. During his illness,
which continued many weeks, he seemed neither
to regret his youth nor hopes; was patient, complaisant,
and indulgent; and a few days before his death
gave proof of his good sense and good nature. A
man of quality that attended him had the brutal absurdity
to solicit him to ask some favour, on his behalf,
of the King, “who,” said the person, “can refuse your
Royal Highness nothing in your present condition.”
The Dauphin laughed at the indelicacy, but would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
not divulge the name of the man. To please his
family the Prince went through all the ceremonies
of the Church, but shewed to his attendants,
after they were over, how vain and ridiculous he
thought them. Many expressions he dropped in
his last hours that spoke the freedom of his opinions;
and to the Duc de Nivernois he said, he was glad to
leave behind him such a book as Mr. Hume’s Essays.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<p>The Dauphiness, with whom he lived on the best
terms, he had, however, no fondness for: his first
wife had been far more dear to him. The second
was morose and ungracious; and, dying in a year
after her husband, was not at all regretted. In her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
last moments, having sharply reprimanded the
Duchesse de Lauragais, the latter, turning to another
lady, said, “Cette Princesse est si bonne, qu’elle
veut que personne ne la regrette.”<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></p>

<p>The Duc de Choiseul, the Prime Minister, was a
man of excellent parts, but of a levity and indiscretion,
which most of that nation divest themselves
of before his age, or when they enter into business.
Except the hours which he spent with the King,
the rest of his life was dissipation, pleasure, profuseness,
and bons mots. Rash, daring, and presumptuous;
good-humoured, but neither good nor ill-natured;
frank, gay, and thoughtless, he seemed
the Sovereign more than the Minister of a mighty
kingdom. Scorning, rather than fearing, his enemies,
he seldom undermined and seldom punished
them. He dissipated the nation’s wealth and his
own; but did not repair the latter by plunder of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
former. Mr. Pitt’s superiority he could never digest
nor forgive; and though he was incapable of little
mischief in his own country, great crimes had rather
a charm for him. He excited the war between the
Russians and Turks, to be revenged on the Czarina;
and I saw him exult childishly in his own house on
her first defeats. At last he descended to the mean
and cruel oppression of Corsica, for the sake of gathering
a diminutive laurel, after being baffled in the
large war. Gallantry without delicacy was his constant
pursuit. His wife, the most perfect character
of her sex, loved him to idolatry;<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> but, though a
civil husband, he spared her no mortification that
his carelessness could inflict. His sister, the Duchesse
de Grammont, too openly connected with
him by more ties than of blood, had absolute influence
over him, and exerted it cruelly and grossly to
insult the Duchesse de Choiseul, who, more than
once, was on the point of retiring into a convent,
though without the least belief of the doctrines held
there. Madame de Grammont, who had none of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
accomplishments that graced the small but harmonious
figure of the Duchesse de Choiseul, had masculine
sense, and almost masculine manners. She
was wonderfully agreeable when she pleased, a vehement
friend, a rude and insolent enemy. The
nation revered and neglected the wife; detested
and bowed to the sister. The Minister had crushed
the Jesuits, for he loved sudden strokes of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">éclat</i>;
and, to carry that measure, had countenanced the
Parliaments till they grew almost too ungovernable.
But as he seldom acted on deep system, he sometimes
took up a tone of authority, and as quickly
relaxed it—a conduct that confounded the nation
and a little the Parliaments; but that war from
thoughtlessness, or to ruin a rival, the Duc d’Aiguillon,
he chiefly left to the latter; and he could not
have left it to worse hands. Proud, ambitious, vindictive,
and void of honour or principle, the Duc
d’Aiguillon, with very moderate parts, aimed at power
with the Crown, by being the Minister of its tyranny.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
The infamous oppression exercised on that undaunted
man, M. de la Chalotais,<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> flowed from the
revenge of this Duc, who, to carry his point, lent
himself even to the exploded Jesuits: and though
that connection could be no secret to the Duc de
Choiseul, he suffered rather than encouraged a plan
that clashed so much with the service he had rendered
to his country by abolishing the Order. Nor
was it to his honour that shame and the outcry of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
mankind rescued M. de la Chalotais, rather than
the justice of the Prime Minister.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></p>

<p>The Parliaments of France were filled with many
great, able, and steady magistrates. The philosophy
and studies of the age had opened their eyes
on the rights of mankind; and they attempted with
heroic firmness to shake off the chains that galled
their country. Yet a distinction should be made
between the magistrates and the men called or calling
themselves philosophers. The latter were really
a set of authors and beaux esprits, who, aping the
sentiments of Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire,
especially of the latter, endeavoured to raise themselves
to an independent rank, to a kind of legislation
in the community. After attacking and throwing
off Christianity, they ran wildly into the fondest
and most absurd doctrines of the old Greek philosophers;
and, with the lightness of their own nation,
and prompted by arrogance and love of pre-eminent
singularity, they wrote atheism with little
reserve, and talked it without any. The chief of
these vain and loquacious witlings were D’Alembert,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a>
Diderot, and that puny writer Marmontel. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
am sorry to add to the list the name of a far more
amiable and more profound man, M. Buffon,
though, except in their indecent petulance, he too
much resembled the rest of his cotemporaries in his
sentiments. The women, who hurry into any new
fashion, and then lead it, talked of matter and metaphysics
with as little caution and as much ignorance
as their directors. The magistrates of the Parliaments
were very different men. Sober on the religion
of their country, they meddled with it no farther
than as it interfered with liberty; and few of
them were so audacious in their most private conversation
as to adopt the abominable licentiousness
of the men I have been describing. But if they were
decent on religion, they had not the same prudence
in the conduct of their civil views. Heated by the
term <em>Parliament</em>, they chose to believe, at least to
inculcate the belief, that they were possessed of the
rights of a British Senate. Nothing could be more
meritorious than a struggle for such a system. But
the Parliaments of France were not only nothing
but courts of judicature, but the pretension was
too early and too untimely to be yet pushed. As I
had some friends in the Parliament of Paris, I remonstrated
to them on the danger they ran of over-turning
an excellent cause by their precipitation.
To obtain solidly and step by step some material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
concessions, was the conduct they should have pursued.
Whatever little they should so attain would
be a benefit to the nation; time and precedent might
add more. A minority or national distress would
have opened a wider door; but by setting out
with unbounded pretensions, unfounded in their
Constitution, they warned the Crown to be on its
guard; and, what was worse, they could depend
on no support but in their own courage and in
that uncertain resource, patriotic martyrdom. The
Crown, popular in France whenever it pleases, and
almost in any country, and powerful without popularity
in that country, could not but regard their
pretensions with the eye of jealousy. The nobility,
ignorant, haughty, and willing to be tyrannized over
by <em>one</em> that they might be authorized to tyrannize
over <em>thousands</em>, were, and must be, disinclined to the
extension of subordinate jurisdiction. The clergy
were the natural and now the provoked enemies of
the Parliaments. The military are seldom captivated
by any franchises but their own; are devoted to
the Crown, and led by, and composed of, the nobility:
nor did the Parliaments take any pains to make
a schism in the soldiery. Even the people, who
would taste most benefit from acquisitions to liberty,
were disinclined to the Parliaments. The Presidents
purchase their charges, and enjoy them with a<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
and haughtiness that is ill-relished by the commonalty.
Able manifestos were slight arms against
such a combination of prejudices. While I staid in
France I had an opportunity of seeing with what
a momentary breath the Crown could puff away a
cloud and tempest of remonstrances. Being pushed
too home, the King, suddenly and very early in the
morning, appeared in the Chamber of Parliament.
The Magistrates were in bed, were summoned, and
found the King surrounded with his guards, and
with all the apparatus of majesty. He commanded
four of his Ministers to take their seats at his feet
in a place where they had no right. He called for
the registers, tore out their remonstrances, enjoined
silence to the Parliament, and departed. In the
street he met the Sacrament, alighted from his
coach, knelt in the dirt, and received the blessings of
all the old beggar-women. By night the consternation
was universal; no man dropped a word, unless in
commendation of the King’s firmness. The Magistrates
sighed, but respectfully. The philosophers
were frightened out of their senses. In a few
months the Parliaments recovered their spirit, and
the Court again temporized. Yet when their memorials
had been read, and had their vogue in common
with the poems and operas of the week, the
sensation ceased, and lettres de cachet lost nothing
of their vigour.</p>

<p>There was scarce a man of quality in France
above the rank of president that countenanced the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
cause. There was one of the blood royal that affected
to be their protector; but too much despised
by the Court, too inconsiderable and too half-witted
to hurt anybody but himself. This was the Prince
of Conti. Handsome and royal in his figure, gracious
at times, but arrogant and overbearing, luxurious
and expensive, he had gathered together a sort
of Court of those who had no hopes at the King’s,
but without the power of giving or receiving any
support. Confused in his ideas, yet clear in his
opinion of superior intelligence, he was at once diffuse
and incomprehensible. The little tyrant of a
puny circle, he gave himself for the patron of
liberty. No man would have carried his own privileges
farther. The Court took no umbrage at such
a foe.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></p>

<p>It could not but be a singular satisfaction to me
to find in so adverse a nation so few men whose
abilities were formidable. One or two of the subordinate
Ministers were men of domestic and civil
address. The Prince de Soubise, a sensible man of
fair character, who enjoyed the most personal favour
with the King, and, it was thought, might be Minister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
if he pleased, had no ambition.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> The Maréchal
d’Estrèes was a good-humoured old nurse;<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> the
Maréchal de Broglie<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> as empty a man, except in the
theory of discipline, as ever I knew. The Comte,
his brother, who had more parts, had not enough to
make them useful;<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> and both brothers were in disgrace.
The Marquess de Castries,<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> a good officer, was
not on any terms with Choiseul, and was no deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
genius. The Duc de Praslin, the Minister’s cousin,
was ill-tempered and disagreeable, and far from possessing
superior abilities.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> The clergy were at a low
ebb. The Archbishop of Toulouse, reckoned the
most rising of the order, was aspiring and artful, but
absorbed in his own attention to intrigue, which
gave him an air of absence. He was only considerable
by comparison.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> He and many of his order did
not disguise their contempt for their own religion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
As the women who had most sway were Freethinkers,
a fashionable clergyman was by consequence an
infidel. The ablest man I knew, and he as indiscreet
as the Duc de Choiseul, was the old Comte de
Maurepas. Lively, gay, and agreeable, he seemed
to feel no regret for his disgrace, though he ought
to have blushed at the imprudence that occasioned it.
He had not only caused to be written, but himself,
at his own table at Versailles, before a large company,
had sung, a severe ballad on Madame de Pompadour.
His fall and a long exile were the consequence.
To make his ruin irrecoverable, she persuaded
the King that he had poisoned a former
mistress, the Duchesse de Chateauroux. From the
same animosity, Madame de Pompadour had diverted
a large sum that Maurepas had destined to re-establish
their marine. Knowing his enmity to this
country, I told him, and the compliment was true,
that it was fortunate for England that he had been
so long divested of power.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<p class="hang50 b2">Death of the Pretender.—Intrigues against the Ministry.—Debates
on the Stamp Act, and the Petition from America.—First Speech
of Mr. Edmund Burke.—Character of his Oratory.—Mr. William
Burke.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the first day of the year died at Albano
that sport of fortune, the Chevalier de St. George,
better known by the appellation of the Old Pretender.
He had not only outlived his hopes, but
almost all those who had given him any hopes.
His party was dwindled to scarce any but Catholics;
and though he left two sons, his line was verging to
extinction. The second son was actually a Cardinal;
the elder, sunk in drunkenness, despair, and neglect
at Bouillon.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> His father’s death seemed a little to
reanimate him: but that revival was but waking to
new mortification. The Court of France did not
even put on mourning for the father; and when
Prince Charles determined to set out for Rome,
the Pope despatched a courier to prevent him. The
Roman nobility were not fond of being preceded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
even by a phantom of royalty; and both they and
the College of Cardinals were apprehensive of the
sottishness and rashness of the young man. The
Pope dreaded the resentment of England, and
feared an order to prohibit English travellers from
visiting Rome; a mighty source of wealth to that
city. And he,<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> who had so obstinately protected
the Jesuits against the threats of France and Spain,
and who at last sacrificed part of his dominions<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> to
his zeal for the Order, had the timidity to renounce
the most meritorious martyr of the Church, rather
than expose himself to the very uncertain vengeance
of a heretic Court. The Young Pretender
persisted in his journey: the Pope as pertinaciously
refused to acknowledge him for King of England;
yet with the additional absurdity of continuing to
style him Prince of Wales—though he could not
be the latter without becoming the former. To
such complete humiliation was reduced that ever
unfortunate house of Stuart, now at last denied
that empty sound of royalty by that Church and
Court for which they had sacrificed three kingdoms!
Pathetically might the Prince have exclaimed,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Hic pietatis honos! sic nos in sceptra reponis!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The Cardinal of York ceded to his brother the
annuity he received from the Pope, whose only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
bounty, whose only grace was restricted to the
allowance of that exchange.</p>

<p>About the same time died Frederick the Fifth,
King of Denmark, in the forty-second year of his
age:<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> a good prince and beloved, and void of any
capital fault but that northern vice drunkenness.
If we may believe the history of that kingdom, no
nation has been blessed with so many humane
sovereigns. It is more remarkable that they have
not grown worse since they became absolute.</p>

<p>Before, and during the adjournment of the Parliament,
the Ministers perceived how little they
could flatter themselves with the stability of their
situation. From being persecuted by both factions
of the old and new Administration, Lord Bute
began to assume the style of holding the balance
between both. He meant at least to show the
new Ministers, that while they disdained to humble
themselves before him, the success of their measures
would be precarious. The Crown itself seemed
inclined to consign its numbers to him against its
own measures—a wise equilibrium, that either way
produced confusion to its interests. Before Christmas,
the Favourite had held a council of his creatures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
at the Earl of Northumberland’s; the meeting
consisted of eighteen Lords and Commoners, and
in the latter number was Charles Townshend.
Dinners were afterwards given to twenty-five Lords
by Bute himself, and others to the Commons by
Lord Litchfield. And lest mankind should misapprehend
the part the Favourite intended to take
on the Stamp Act, Lord Denbigh, his standard-bearer,
and Augustus Hervey, asked audiences of the
King, and leave to resign their places, as they purposed
to vote against the repeal. The farce was
carried on by the King, and to prevent any panic
in those who might have a mind to act the same
part, his Majesty told them, that they <em>were at liberty
to vote against him and keep their places</em>. This was, in
effect, ordering his servants to oppose his Ministers.
The latter, on this exigence, consulted Mr. Pitt,
desired his advice for their conduct on the Stamp
Act, and invited him to take the lead in their
Administration. He replied, with his usual haughtiness,
that he would give no advice but to his
Majesty or the Parliament; that he would never
sit at Council with Newcastle;<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> and should think
himself obliged to offer the Treasury to Lord
Temple; and that there must be <em>other</em> arrangements.
Those arrangements, he intimated, were,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
that whether Lord Temple accepted the Treasury
or not, Lord Rockingham must not expect to continue
there.</p>

<p>This answer being reported to the Council, who
had obtained the King’s permission to make the
overture, gave great offence, particularly to Newcastle,
who found himself proscribed; and to Rockingham,
who cared not whether he were proscribed
or not, if he was to be divested of the Treasury.
It was warmly decided that it would wound the
King’s honour to send any more messages to a
man who had thus often rejected his Majesty’s
condescension. But though this message had been
suffered, it had by no means had the King’s approbation,
who now no longer wished that Mr. Pitt
should unite with the present Ministers; and it
was as little his intention to bind himself by the
rules they prescribed to his honour. He did not
despair of gaining Mr. Pitt alone and unconnected,
who, the King and the Favourite flattered themselves,
would be more complaisant than either of
the factions. If indulged in his foreign plans, he
was less likely than any man to interfere in the
scheme of domestic power. Anything was to be
sacrificed to accommodate the Favourite, to save his
creatures, and to preserve his influence. Could that
be maintained, the Crown would be rewarded with
new extension of the prerogative. This reciprocal
view was the key to all the secrets of the closet,
was the source of all the indignities past, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
disgraceful fluctuation that ensued, and of all the
humiliations that fell on the King himself, who
unfortunately had been taught to prefer a forced
authority to that which flows, and was so disposed
to flow, from the love of his subjects.</p>

<p>On the 14th of January the Houses met. Lord
Villiers<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> and Mr. Thomas Townshend moved the
Addresses. Seymour and Bamber Gascoyne, Nugent
and Stanley, attacked the Ministers for their
want of spirit against the Americans, and for suffering
the authority of Parliament to be called in
question by the rebellious Colonies. “The tax,”
said Stanley, “was not a twentieth part of what
they could afford to pay; but that was not the
point: he had rather have a peppercorn to acknowledge
our sovereignty, than millions paid into the
Treasury without it.” As he was speaking, Mr.
Pitt appeared in the House, and took the first
opportunity of opening his mind, not only on the
Stamp Act, but on the general situation of affairs.
Though he had on other occasions, perhaps, exerted
more powers of eloquence (though he was much admired
now even in that light), yet the novelty and
boldness of his doctrines, the offence he gave by
them at home, and the delirium which they excited
in America, made his speech rank in celebrity with
his most famous orations. For these reasons, and
as the repeal of the Stamp Act was the last great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
question on which he figured in the House of Commons,
I shall be more particular in the detail of it,
having received authentic notes from one that was
present at the delivery, and therefore more to be
depended on than the printed copy.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></p>

<p>He had come to town that morning, he said, <em>unconcerted</em>
and unconnected, and not having arrived
early enough, desired to hear the proposed Address
read, which being done, he thought it, he said, a
very proper one, though he should wish to separate
from it the unhappy measure of the Stamp Act.
No day had been so important since the time, a
little above a century ago, when it had been debated
whether we should be bond or free. More
than ordinary circumspection was requisite on that
nice, difficult, and hardly debateable question.
Truth did extort from him that the compliment
of <em>early</em> applied to the present meeting of Parliament
did <em>not</em> belong to the American part of the
question. <em>He</em> would have called the Parliament
sooner. He then pronounced that <em>the House of
Commons did not represent North America</em>. It had,
as the Legislature, not as representatives, taxed
North America. For him, the question was too
hard; but, popular or unpopular, he would do as
he thought right. Was there a set of men in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
country by whom he had not been sacrificed? He
saw before him a set of gentlemen whom he respected—some
of them his old acquaintance; these
were part of the Administration: but were there
not other parts? One day one man was uppermost,
another day, another man. Was there not an invisible
influence from more quarters than one? No
matter whence they came, if they did mischief—God
knew whither this country was going! Had
we not seen one Ministry changed after another,
and passing away like shadows? All that could be
done for this country was to place it in a safe situation.
When he served his Majesty, he had mentioned
it as his advice that he wished to have that
part of the Act of Settlement enforced, which directs
that every Minister should sign his opinion.
Liberty formerly was not made use of as a horse
to ride into employment upon; they rode into the
field upon it, and left their bones there. As he
might be deprived by ill health from attending his
duty in the House when this question should come
on, he begged leave to deliver his opinion then.
He would repeal the Stamp Act immediately, and
accompany it with a bill declaratory of their own
high rights and privileges over that country, which
should be done upon the most extensive plan. But
he would repeat it, <em>That House had no right to lay
an internal tax upon America, that country not being
represented</em>.</p>

<p>General Conway said, he had the honour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
agreeing with almost every word that had fallen
from Mr. Pitt; but if there was any blame to
be cast for not meeting the Parliament sooner, he
must bear it in common with the rest of his Majesty’s
servants who advised it. For himself he
had been unworthily and accidentally called to the
high employment he then bore; he had not studiously
thrust himself into it, and could assure the
right honourable gentleman that he should think
himself happy to resign it to him whenever he
should please to take it. Himself had not made
use of liberty to ride into employment; it was indifferent
to him, and he should be equally happy
to turn his horse’s head and ride out again.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt assured him that he had not glanced at
him in any word he had uttered, he had too high an
opinion of him. The only piece of advice he would
give Mr. Conway was not to be ridden, and he
dared to say he never would.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></p>

<p>Mr. Grenville said, the Stamp Act had been thoroughly
considered, not hurried at the end of a session.
It had passed through the different stages in
full Houses with, he thought, only one division on it.
“Look,” said he, “into Magna Charta; you will see
we have a right to tax America; and that all laws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
are enacted by Commune Consilium Regni: and
will the honourable gentleman then say we have
not a right”—He was interrupted by Pitt; and, after
some squabbling and explanation, Grenville continued:
“Why then I understand the gentleman’s opinion
to be, that you have a right on every other
occasion except to lay an internal tax”—Being
again interrupted, Mr. Pitt begged to be indulged
in a few words by way of reply, and then, as was
common with him, launched out into a new harangue:
“Though the gentleman,” said he, “is armed
at all points with Acts of Parliament, yet I will
venture to say that if he was to take the three first
words that he might find in a dictionary, they would
be full as much to the purpose as his Commune
Consilium Regni. Does he consider that, at the
time he speaks of, the barons had all the land—though
indeed the Church, God bless it! had then
a third, when the bishops, mitred abbots, and such
things, had influence? I laugh, sir, I laugh, when
it is said this country cannot coerce America; but
will you do it upon a point that is intricate, and in
a matter of right that is disputed? Will you, after
the Peace you have made, and the small pittance of
the fishery that is left you, will you sheath your
sword in the bowels of your brothers, the Americans?
You may coerce and conquer, but when
they fall, they will fall like the strong man embracing
the pillars of this Constitution, and bury it
in ruin with them. Gentlemen may double down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
Acts of Parliament till they are dogseared, it will
have no effect upon me; I am past the time of life
to be turning to books to know whether I love
liberty or not. There are two or three lines of

<p>“I don’t know how it is,” continued he, “when I
had something to do in advising, there were always
three hundred gentlemen ready to be of my opinion—I
don’t know how it came about—perhaps it was
their modesty—I wish they would not be quite so
modest. Indeed there was one person who is now
gone to the House of Lords, and sits there by an
old barony,<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> who was honest enough to disagree
with me, and called it <em>my</em> German war: I have
loved him ever since for being so honest to speak
his mind; I see his employment is taken from him;
had I been employed, he is one of the first persons
I should have endeavoured to keep in, for no other
reason but because he had differed with me. When
I was in power, I do not doubt but I had friends
who would have advised me to burn my fingers, and
would have recommended such a tax as this. Look
at past Ministers, and see what they thought of it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
Lord Halifax,<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> educated in this House, Lord Oxford,<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a>
Lord Orford,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> a great revenue minister, never thought
of <span class="smcap smaller">THIS</span>. If you had the right, it would be a fatal
policy; for will not that people, if they share your
taxes, claim the right of manufactures, of free trade,
of every other privilege of the mother-country?
An honourable gentleman talked of a barleycorn;
I say this tax is but a barleycorn—fifty thousand
pounds are but a barleycorn. Will you have your
Treasury look big at the expense of two millions?
My ideas and knowledge of America have been
chiefly learnt from gentlemen of the army. There
is not the captain of a company of foot that is not
fit to be a Governor of North America. How can
you depend upon Spain after the treatment she has
shown to that brave and gallant officer,<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> who has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
suffered for his lenity towards them at the Manillas,
and now feels their perfidy? It were to be wished
that the heart of every grandee in Spain beat as
high as his! In the situation things are, nobody
can trade in North America but a lawyer. I hate
distinctions; I do not consider the soil or the cradle
where a man is nursed; I look for sense and wisdom,
if he has it. I have done all in my power to
show I hate distinctions. Before this war it was a
measure not to trust the sword in the hands of the
northern part of his Majesty’s subjects; but the late
war convinced everybody what just praise they deserved
for their conduct.” Here he was called to
order by Mr. Grenville, who said, “This is not the
first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth time that
the honourable gentleman has mistaken or misrepresented.
I have also been misrepresented upon
other subjects, particularly with regard to the Spanish
trade. I call upon gentlemen now in power to
prove I gave any orders to prevent that trade, or
any other, but at the request of the merchants
themselves.” Here Mr. Grenville himself was called
to order by Lord Strange, who observed, how much
Pitt and Grenville had led the House astray from
the debate; which Onslow excused by saying, that
the first day of a Session, when the King’s speech
is debated, is always understood to be a day of free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
conversation. Still much confusion ensued; and at
last the Chancellor of the Exchequer<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> said, in answer
to Grenville, that when accounts relative to
trade should be produced, they would prove to be
in a melancholy state. Mr. Conway said, that the
explanation which Mr. Pitt had been pleased to
give, had relieved his mind; he considered from
how high a drop fell that fell from him, and what
an effect it had upon the rest of the world. He
assured Mr. Pitt how ready he was, he would not
say, to act with him, but under him, and declared he
knew at present of no hidden influence. The Address
passed without a negative.</p>

<p>Mr. Conway, then, by order of his Majesty, presented
at the bar the letters and different intelligence
to and from America, and moved to have
them taken into consideration on the Thursday
sevennight following.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> Mr. Rigby proposed to
have them printed. Mr. Conway observed, that
those papers mentioned particular names of men
and their transactions, and therefore objected to
the printing. Mr. Nugent said, Too much had
been done now to leave any room for secrecy; and
Mr. Conway gave it up. Huske<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> told the House
very properly, that, if they printed the names, they
would never have any more intelligence: on which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
the Attorney-General proposed, as was done on the
inquiry into the loss of Minorca, to print the papers,
but omit names. It passed, however, for printing
all. The next day Sir George Saville, who had been
absent, and the Speaker,<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> who had been uneasy at
the order for printing the names, prevailed to have
the order for the names revoked, and the Speaker
was entrusted with the supervisal.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt’s speech, as I have said, gave great
offence, and even to the Scotch, though he had
endeavoured to distinguish them from Lord Bute.
It was a greater disappointment to the late Ministers,
who had not expected that he would prove
so favourable to their successors. Lord Sandwich,
so recently a persecutor of Wilkes and the press,
had now set up a most virulent and scurrilous
paper, called Anti-Sejanus,<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> written by one Scott,
an hireling parson, and chiefly levelled at Lord
Bute. Concluding that Mr. Pitt did not approve
of any men who enjoyed the power at which he
himself aimed, the new daily libel set out with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
profuse encomiums on him. It now took a short
turn, and involved Mr. Pitt, too, in a medley of
scurrility; but what with want of talents, what with
want of decency, this paper was one of those few
vehicles of ribaldry which was forced to put itself
to death before the object of its patron was answered.</p>

<p>On the 27th of January, Mr. Cooke, of Middlesex,
presented a petition from some of the North
American provinces assembled in Congress, against
the Stamp Act. Jenkinson and Dyson, placemen,
but creatures of Lord Bute, opposed receiving it;
as did Nugent and Ellis, who called it a dangerous
federal union. Dowdeswell, the new Chancellor of
the Exchequer, agreed with them, as there was
nothing, he said, in the petition, but what had been
already received in others from the separate provinces,
and therefore he wished Cooke to withdraw
what he had offered. Mr. Pitt warmly undertook
the protection of the petition, which he affirmed
was innocent, dutiful, and respectful. He did not
know the time, he said, when he had been counsellor
to timid councils; but on this occasion should
have thought it happy to have made this the first
act of harmony. He painted the Americans as
people who, in an ill-fated hour, had left this
country to fly from the Star Chamber and High
Commission Courts. The desert smiled upon them
in comparison of this country. It was the evil
genius of this country that had riveted amongst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
them this union, now called <em>dangerous and federal</em>.
He did not see but honest Wildman’s<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> or Newmarket
might be talked of in the same strain. This
country upon occasion has its meetings, and nobody
objects to them; but the names of six or eight
Americans are to be big with danger. He could
not guess, by the turn of the debate, whether the
Administration intended lenity or not. To him lenity
was recommended by every argument. He would
emphatically hear the Colonies upon this their
petition. The right of representation and taxation
always went together and should never be separated.
Except for the principles of Government, records
were out of the question. “<em>You have broken</em>,”
continued he, “<em>the original compact, if you have
not a right of taxation</em>.” The repeal of the Stamp
Act was an inferior consideration to receiving this
petition.</p>

<p>Sir Fletcher Norton rose with great heat, and
said, He could hardly keep his temper at some words
that had fallen from the right honourable gentleman.
He had said, that the original compact had
been broken between us and America, if the House
had not the right of taxation. Pitt rose to explain—Norton
continued; “The gentleman now says, I
mistook his words; I do not now understand them.”
Pitt interrupted him angrily, and said, “I did say the
Colony compact would be broken—and what then?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
Norton replied, “The gentleman speaks out now,
and I understand him; and if the House go along
with me, the gentleman will go to another place.”<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a>
Pitt at this looked with the utmost contempt, tossed
up his chin, and cried, “Oh! oh!—oh! oh!” “I
will bear that from no man,” said Norton: “changing
their place, did not make Englishmen change
their allegiance. I say the gentleman sounds the
trumpet to rebellion; or would he have the strangers
in the gallery go away with these his opinions?
He has chilled my blood at the idea.” “The
gentleman,” rejoined Pitt, “says I have chilled his
blood: I shall be glad to meet him in any place
with the same opinions, when his blood is warmer.”</p>

<p>Hussey, Colonel Barré, Thurlow, and, of the Ministerial
people, Lord Howe and Onslow, only were
for hearing the petition; but Conway objected, as it
came from the Congress, and said, if the separate
petitions had been heard last year, this would not
have happened now. He wished to have the petition
withdrawn, as he should be sorry to have a
negative put upon it. George Grenville insisted on
the House deciding as the question had been proposed.
Burke, who maintained that the very presentation
of the petition was an acknowledgment of
the right of the House, declared for receiving it;
but Lord John Cavendish and Alderman Baker
declaring they thought it of little importance; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
the former moving for the orders of the day, that
motion was carried without a division.</p>

<p>There appeared in this debate a new speaker,
whose fame for eloquence soon rose high above the
ordinary pitch. His name was Edmund Burke,
(whom I have just mentioned,) an Irishman, of a
Roman Catholic family, and actually married to one
of that persuasion.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> He had been known to the
public for a few years by his “Essay on the Sublime
and Beautiful,” and other ingenious works; but the
narrowness of his fortune had kept him down, and
his best revenue had arisen from writing for booksellers.
Lord Rockingham, on being raised to the
head of the Treasury, had taken Burke for his private
Secretary, as Mr. Conway had his cousin William.
Edmund immediately proved a bitter scourge
to George Grenville, whose tedious harangues he
ridiculed with infinite wit, and answered with equal
argument. Grenville himself was not more copious;
but, with unexhausted fertility, Burke had an imagination
that poured out new ideas, metaphors, and
allusions, which came forth ready dressed in the
most ornamental and yet the most correct language.
In truth, he was so fond of flowers, that he snatched
them, if they presented themselves, even from Ovid’s
Metamorphoses. His wit, though prepared, seldom
failed him; his judgment often. Aiming always at
the brilliant, and rarely concise, it appeared that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
felt nothing really but the lust of applause. His
knowledge was infinite, but vanity had the only key
to it; and though no doubt he aspired highly, he
seemed content when he had satisfied the glory of
the day, whatever proved the event of the debate.
This kind of eloquence contented himself, and often
his party; but the House grew weary at length of
so many essays. Having come too late into public
life, and being too conceited to study men whom he
thought his inferiors in ability, he proved a very indifferent
politician—the case of many men I have
known, who have dealt too much in books or a profession:
they apply their knowledge to objects to
which it does not belong, and think it as easy to
govern men, when they rise above them, as they
found when themselves were lower and led their
superiors by flattery. It is perhaps more expedient
for a man of mean birth to be humble after his
exaltation than before. Insolence is more easily
tolerated in an inferior, than in an inferior mounted
above his superiors.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<p>William Burke, the cousin of Edmund, wrote
with ingenuity and sharpness; and both of them
were serviceable to the new Administration, by
party papers. But William, as an orator, had
neither manner nor talents, and yet wanted little
of his cousin’s presumption.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> Edmund, though the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
idol of his party, had nothing of the pathetic and
imposing dignity of Pitt, though possessed of far
more knowledge, and more reasoning abilities. But
Pitt could awe those whom he could no longer lead,
and never seemed <em>greater</em> than when abandoned by all.
Charles Townshend, who had studied nothing accurately
or with attention, had parts that embraced
all knowledge with such quickness, that he seemed
to create knowledge instead of searching for it;
and, ready as Burke’s wit was, it appeared artificial
when set by that of Charles Townshend, which was
so abundant, that in him it seemed a loss of time
to think. He had but to speak, and all he said
was new, natural, and yet uncommon. If Burke
replied extempore, his very answers, that sprang
from what had been said by others, were so painted
and artfully arranged, that they wore the appearance
of study and preparation: like beautiful
translations, they seemed to want the soul of the
original author. Townshend’s speeches, like the
Satires of Pope, had a thousand times more sense
and meaning than the majestic blank verse of Pitt;
and yet, the latter, like Milton, stalked with a conscious
dignity of pre-eminence, and fascinated his
audience with that respect which always attends the
pompous but often hollow idea of the sublime.</p>

<p>The situation of the Ministers became every day
more irksome and precarious. On the last day of
January they carried a question by so small a majority,
that, according to Parliamentary divination, it
had all the aspect of an overthrow. Mr. Wedderburne
had presented a Scotch petition, and moved
to have it heard on that day month. The Ministers,
disinclined to it, proposed to defer it for six
weeks, and prevailed but by 148 against 139;<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> the
Grooms of the Bedchamber, Lord Strange, Chancellor
of the Duchy, Lord Mount Stewart,<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> Dyson,
and even Lord George Sackville,<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> so recently preferred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
by the Ministers, being in the minority, and
Charles Townshend declining to vote. To shake
the credit of the Ministers, at least to humble them
by promoting a vigorous Opposition to their measures,
Lord Bute’s agents affectedly sought the
company of the discontented chiefs, and hung out
to them hopes of Lord Bute’s support. His greatest
dread was union against him; his constant and
repeated practice, to break and divide all parties
and connections. In the crisis of which I am
speaking, he was particularly anxious to prevent the
junction of Mr. Pitt and the Ministers. The latter,
notwithstanding so many unpromising appearances,
and having nothing to fear but the loss of their
places if firm, of their characters if they temporized,
maintained their ground, and</p>

<p>On February the 3rd Mr. Secretary Conway, in
consequence of the papers that had been delivered
and read in the Committee, proposed to vote five
resolutions, which, he said, the world would expect
in consequence of the notices laid before Parliament.
A friend to the Americans he professed himself;
but begged not to be understood to pledge himself
for future measures, nor even for the repeal of the
Stamp Act; yet could he but feel for that country,
to whose miseries nothing was wanting but a scene
of blood, and whose language was the language of
despair? He thought them to blame; but he
thought them pardonable. “The other day,” said
he, “all had been peace and harmony in that country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
All order of things had been reversed since
the Stamp Act. The late Acts of Parliament had
been so many repeated blows on those people.
Look at other countries; they never bear fresh
taxes. There was even then uneasinesses in the
Colonies of our enemies. The richest provinces had
been thrown away by the imposition of new taxes.
He would mention the grievances of America historically,
as the Sugar Act, and the swarms of
cutters to interrupt the Spanish dollar trade. This
Act was false in its principles, and dangerous in its
policy. Himself should never be for internal taxes,
and would sooner cut off his hand, than sign an
order for sending out force to maintain them.” He
then read the following <span class="locked">resolutions:—</span></p>

<p>First.—That Great Britain had, hath, and ought
to have full right and power to bind the Americans
in all cases whatsoever.</p>

<p>Second.—That tumults have been carried on.</p>

<p>Third.—That the votes of the assemblies are
illegal.</p>

<p>Fourth.—Humbly to address his Majesty to bring
the authors of riots to condign punishment.</p>

<p>Fifth.—To address, that the sufferers by riots
be compensated.</p>

<p>He added, that he looked on the right of taxation
as a point of law; Parliament might take it
up. If he was to be called to account for his
letters, he repeated it again, he would do anything
but exert military force. Whenever the blow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
should come, he would stand on his defence, and
meet it like a man, with all the firmness of justice,
and indifference of innocence.</p>

<p>Stanley spoke for supporting the dignity of the
Constitution, and quoted Mr. Legge for having
had views of raising assistance from America;
which country, he had thought, ought to maintain
its own army. Charles Yorke said, if it was impossible
to carry the Stamp Act into execution,
it was better to repeal it; the House might make
free with its own work. Yet he talked much of
the omnipotence of Parliament, and said, “Lord
Coke had declared he did not know how to set
bounds to its power. Our right was entire, supported
by forms of precedents, and the language
of the Constitution. The moment one part of the
Legislature was given up, no friend would trust
you, no enemy would fear you.” This trimming
speech was ridiculed by Beckford. He saw, he
said, no infallibility in an Act of Parliament: the
learned gentleman had quoted nothing fairly; lawyers
never did. He would prophecy, that the moment
the Stamp Act should be repealed, it would
be like the quarrels of lovers, the renewal of love.
Nugent said, the subjects who went from this
country, had carried with them their privileges,
but had left their duty behind. Dr. Blackstone,
an able writer, but an indifferent speaker, declared,
<em>Tory</em> as he was, that Parliament had no
right to impose internal taxes. Hussey pleaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
for the Colonies, and urged that internal taxes
had never been carried so far as by the Stamp
Act. The House ought to have said, “Pay, or
we will tax you.” To this hardship had been
added that of taking away their trials by juries.
He advised to exercise legislation with justice and
humanity; and concluded, that Parliament ought
to consider less the acts of the Americans, than
their own. Wedderburne was as warm for sticking
to fundamentals, as Hussey had been temperate.
Burke, allowing the right of taxation, and
that their own charters were against the Americans,
was yet for temporizing, according to the
variation of circumstances, the neglect of which
had brought Ministers into disgrace. Principles
should be subordinate to Government. The Stamp
Act, on account of the dignity of the mischief it
had produced, required the discussion of a particular
debate. Lord Frederick Campbell objected
to distinctions between theory and practice, which,
he said, had brought on the Revolution. If the
Americans carried with them their liberty, how
came it that the King in Council had a right
to tax them? Colonel Barré talked of the Americans
as worse treated than French or Spanish
provinces. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said,
that the Parliament’s power of taking away their
charters gave it a right of taxation; but to repeal
the Act would be a safer way.</p>

<p>George Grenville, who had reserved all his fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
for Conway, attacked him with the utmost animosity.
The Americans had been blameable, but were pardonable
according to the Secretary of State. For
his part, he did not think rebellion pardonable.
He had never advised to resist taxes; had never
advised people to stand to their tackle and resist.
Was there not an order under the gentleman’s
own hand, in papers on the table, to send a military
force? and yet, forsooth, he would sooner
cut off that hand! His insinuation was void of
truth; there were no cutters sent to the West
Indies; no such orders to cruize on the Spanish
trade. He had proposed, and now called on the
House to fix a day for inquiring into that affair. For
shame! let it not be repeated any more. First let the
business be done, and then let it be known by whose
fault affairs had been brought to the present crisis.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt made another oration on general liberty,
and in favour of the Colonies, but not various enough
from the former to demand being particularized. Sir
Fletcher Norton answered him with equal warmth—and
then burst out such a confutation of the lies
Mr. Grenville had been venting, that it was wonderful
how even <em>his</em> pallid features could quench the
blush of shame. Conway acquainted the House that
he had two letters in his hand, one from Sir William
Burnaby,<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> acquainting him that the Spanish trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
could not go on under the present regulations;
and he offered to read them to the House, or give
them to Mr. Grenville himself. “I may be <em>mistaken</em>,”
said Conway; “but he shall not say I <em>misrepresent</em>.”
Grenville still repeated that there were
no such orders given to regulate that trade. Admiral
Keppel said, he could take upon himself to
affirm that that trade had suffered; and Huske
undertook to prove to the House, that orders had
been given by the Treasury under Mr. Grenville’s
Administration, relative to the restrictions laid on
the Spanish trade: and Mr. Grenville had no more
to say. At near three in the morning the question
was put, and the first resolution was carried
without a division, Mr. Pitt’s, and four or five
voices only, dissenting: the rest of the propositions
were adjourned to another day.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></p>

<p>In the House of Lords the Opposition ran the Ministers
nearer, and even carried one or two questions
by majorities of four and five. Lord Bute himself,
almost acting patriotism, said, Nothing should oblige
him to be for the King’s wish if he did not approve
the measures of the King’s Ministers. In
the House of Commons the sittings were long,
repeated, and full of warmth; but the Ministers,
supported by the popularity of the measure, and
by the ascendant of Pitt, (which never appeared
more conspicuously, though eccentric,) pursued their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
point, and weak as they were from the treachery of
the Court, from their own inexperience, and from
deficiency of great talents, were able to weather the
various storms that concurred, and concurred only,
for their destruction.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></p>

<p>On the 5th the House went again on the resolutions.
To the second Dyson proposed to add,
<em>whereby the execution of an Act of the last session of
Parliament has in such provinces been defeated</em>. This
was opposed, particularly by Mr. Pitt, though he
said his support could be of little <em>efficacy</em> to American
liberty, standing as he did almost naked in
that House, like a primæval parent, naked, because
innocent; naked, because not ashamed. Elliot declared
for moderating rather than for repealing the
Act, and Grenville himself agreed that it might be
altered; on which Burke triumphed and taunted
him: and Pitt, to whom Grenville had made compliments,
declaring that there he would make his
stand, the amendment was withdrawn. The third
resolution passed without contradiction. The
fourth, Conway himself offered to give up, as too
severe; and Pitt, with encomiums on his constitutional
lenity, encouraging him to depart from it,
it was withdrawn. The fifth occasioned more debate.
Nugent proposed to correct the words, <em>recommend
to governors to recompense the sufferers</em>, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
to substitute the word <em>require</em>; and the Master of
the Rolls declaring the whole resolution illegal, as
the House could not recommend in cases of money,
that motion, too, was given up. Grenville proposed
others for compensation, protection, and indemnification
to the officers of the revenue, &amp;c. Pitt went
away, after highly praising the Ministers, protesting
how desirous he was of agreeing with them, and
assuring them that, as far as he could support them,
they might depend on his support. Grenville’s motions
carried on the debate for two hours more;
when both sides, fearing to divide, and Elliot moderating,
Grenville was, with much difficulty, persuaded
to suffer the amendment of his motions.
Those questions and alterations may be found in the
journals; nor do I pretend to great accuracy in words
of that sort: the sense and substance I mean to give,
the forms may be collected by historians, or corrected
by critics. It is the business of the former,
the existence of the latter, to be nice in minutiæ.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></p>

<p>On the 7th of February the Opposition determined
to try their strength. Mr. Conway acquainted
the Committee that though the voluminous quantity
of his correspondences prevented his being able
as yet to lay them before the House; still that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
deserved the most important consideration, as representing
the deplorable state of that unfortunate
country, America, where all was anarchy and confusion—without
courts, without laws, without justice;
and yet he had not heard a breath of disloyalty,—it
was the countenance of despair. They
looked upon their trade and liberty as gone; and
yet he thought it his duty to acquaint the House
that one of his correspondents was of opinion that
the Stamp Act might still be carried into execution.</p>

<p>Mr. Grenville, untouched and unmoved by so
calamitous a picture, moved to address the King to
give orders for enforcing the laws, and for carrying
all Acts of the English Parliament into execution.
Charles Townshend, making a merit of not having
declared his opinion on the repeal, approved the
Address, and yet disliked the latter words, which
could be interpreted to be levelled at nothing but
the Stamp Act. This was much extended by Burke;
faintly taken up by Yorke; and the motion supported
on the other side by Jenkinson and Norton.
Mr. Pitt, who arrived under extreme pain, argued
against the proposed Address with unusual strength
of argument, and demonstrated the absurdity of
enforcing an Act which in a very few days was likely
to be repealed. He encouraged a division rather
than the admission of such an Address. Such a
question, followed by such a majority as he foresaw
would be against the Address, would show the
weakness of the wisdom, and the weakness of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
numbers of those who proposed and approved it.
Supposing orders should be sent out immediately,
in consequence of such an Address, to enforce the
Act, the scene that would ensue would make the
Committee shudder; what could follow but bloodshed,
and military execution in support of a law,
which perhaps might be repealed in a week’s time,
and our Governors abroad might go on enforcing it
after it was repealed? When he was Secretary of
State, the fleet lay wind-bound in the Channel for
nine or eleven weeks—what would be the consequence
of such an event now? He pressed Grenville
to withdraw his motion; and then, excusing
himself on his illness, went away.</p>

<p>Grenville, as obdurate as the winds of which
Pitt had talked, and who, having checked a glorious
war, seemed to promise himself other triumphs
over his countrymen, expatiated on the
haughtiness of Pitt, and denounced curses on the
Ministers that should sacrifice the sovereignty of
Britain over her Colonies. Conway retorted on
the inhumanity of Grenville, and that sort of intrepidity
that menaced two millions of people, who
were not in a situation to revenge themselves;
and by apt allusion to Grenville’s remorseless despotism,
told him that Count d’Ocyras,<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> the most
intrepid Minister that ever was, had yet rescinded
the duties in the Brazils. In confirmation of Mr.
Pitt’s arguments, he told the House the packet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
would depart in two days; was it advisable to let
it carry this precipitate, and perhaps useless Address
to America? useless, if the Stamp Act was
repealed, as he avowed he hoped it would be.
Nugent argued on the danger of giving way; on
the spirit of resistance this would infuse into the
Irish; and on the contempt with which France
would treat our demands, if we knew not how to
govern our own subjects. The resolutions of the
House, unenforced, would, he said, be holding a
harlequin’s sword over the heads of the Colonists.
Lord Granby declared for, and Sir George Saville
against, the Address. Beckford was bitter on Grenville;
and Norton so abusive on Yorke, that Sir
Alexander Gilmour told him, in his own famous
phrase, that he could have kept company with nothing
but <em>drunken porters</em>. Colonel Onslow with
more good humour, said, he looked upon the altercation
between the two learned gentleman (Yorke
and Norton) as a race for the Chancellorship.
Much personal heat, however, ensued, and put an
end to the debate, when the motion for leaving
the Chair, which had been proposed by Yorke,
was carried (and the Address consequently rejected)
by 274 to 134; the very majority being greater
than the whole amount of the Opposition; though
Lord Bute’s friends and all the Scotch and the
Tories, and Lord Granby, and near a dozen of the
King’s own servants, voted in the minority. It
was matter of ridicule, that in the lists given out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
by Lord Sandwich, <em>their</em> faction had been estimated
at 130; and Lord Bute’s tools had vaunted
that he could command fourscore or ninety votes.
The astonishment and mortification of Grenville
and the Bedfords were unequalled. They had
quarrelled with and defied the Favourite when
they were in power; and were now seeking and
courting his support, when he seemed to have lost
his power almost as much as they had.</p>

<p>The Ministers, however triumphant, were with
reason disgusted at the notorious treachery of the
Court; and remonstrated to the King on the behaviour
of his servants. Evasions and professions
were all the replies; but no alteration of conduct
in consequence. On the contrary, within two days
after the last division in the House of Commons, a
scene broke forth that exhibited a duplicity, at
once so artful, and yet so impolitic, so narrow-minded
in its views, and so dangerous in its tendency,
that the warmest partizans of royalty, of the
Princess, and of the Favourite, will never be able
to efface the stain. What crooked counsels, and
how insincere the mind, which could infuse or imbibe
such lessons!</p>

<p>Lord Strange, one of the placemen who opposed
the repeal of the Stamp Act, having occasion to go
into the King on some affair of his office, the Duchy
of Lancaster, the King said, he heard it was reported
in the world, that he (the King) was for
the repeal of that Act. Lord Strange replied, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
idea did not only prevail, but that his Majesty’s
Ministers did all that lay in their power to encourage
that belief, and that their great majority had
been entirely owing to their having made use of his
Majesty’s name. The King desired Lord Strange
to contradict that report, assuring him it was not
founded. Lord Strange no sooner left the closet
than he made full use of the authority he had received,
and trumpeted all over the town the conversation
he had had with the King. So extraordinary a
tale soon reached the ear of Lord Rockingham, who
immediately asked Lord Strange if it was true what
the King was reported to have said to him? The
other confirmed it. On that, Lord Rockingham
desired the other to meet him at Court, when they
both went into the closet together. Lord Strange
began, and repeated the King’s words; and asked
if he had been mistaken? The King said, “No.”
Lord Rockingham then pulled out a paper, and
begged to know, if on such a day (which was
minuted down on the paper) his Majesty had not
determined for the repeal? Lord Rockingham then
stopped. The King replied, “My Lord, this is but
half;” and taking out a pencil, wrote on the bottom
of Lord Rockingham’s paper words to this effect:
“The question asked me by my Ministers, was,
whether I was for enforcing the Act by the sword,
or for the repeal? Of the two extremes I was for
the repeal; but most certainly preferred modification
to either.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
It is not necessary to remark on this story. The
King had evidently consented to the repeal, and
then disavowed his Ministers, after suffering them
to proceed half-way in their plan, unless it is an
excuse that he secretly fomented opposition to
them all the time. His middle way of modification,
tallying exactly with what had been proposed
in the House of Commons by Elliot and Jenkinson,
proved that, notwithstanding all his Majesty’s and
Lord Bute’s own solemn professions, the latter was
really Minister still; and that no favour could be
obtained but by paying court to him. In such
circumstances is it wonderful that the nation fell
into disgrace and confusion, or that the Crown itself
suffered such humiliations? A King to humour a
timid yet overbearing Favourite, encouraging opposition
to his own Ministers! What a picture of
weakness!</p>

<p>On the 17th happened another very warm debate,
occasioned by Mr. Dowdeswell’s moving to discharge
the order for printing the American papers,
the Speaker having declared that it was impossible
to omit proper names and preserve the sense. The
Opposition called this <em>inconsistency</em>, and threw all
the ridicule they could on the Ministers, for what
they termed variation and unsettled conduct. Wedderburne,
in particular, a very fluent, acute, and bitter
speaker, imputed these changes to the orders of Mr.
Pitt. “The oracle has appeared, the oracle has
spoken,” said he; “those gentlemen have prostrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
themselves before it; but I tremble to think what
will become of them for their inconsistencies. How
will they expiate their crime? how atone for it? I
would advise them to make pilgrimages to Hayes.
Perhaps he may require human sacrifices.” Beckford
and Conway reproached him for not having ventured
to attack Mr. Pitt when he was present. Rigby
turned his artillery on Conway, who had dropped
that he had been forced into his present situation.
“I have heard,” said Rigby, “of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">médecin malgré
lui</i>, never of a Minister <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">malgré lui</i>; nor am I apt to
think that people who do not like their situations,
exert all their abilities—they do not do their best:
I dare say the honourable gentleman does not do
his best. I look upon timidity in a Minister to be
as bad as cowardice in a General.” Lord George
Sackville said, “May we ever have such a Minister
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">malgré lui</i>, who is ready to serve his country and
rescue the dignity of the Sovereign from being
insulted!”</p>

<p>Conway, roused by the brutality of Rigby, yet too
apt to bear public abuse with phlegmatic patience,
both from conscious intrepidity, and from knowing
that such public jarrings are always hindered from
coming to private decision, replied with uncommon
ability and applause. “The gentleman had talked,”
he said, “of timidity in a Minister and cowardice in
a General;—as to timidity on the present measure,
the House would judge whether his conduct had
been timid. Cowardice he was sure the honourable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
gentleman did not mean to apply to him;” said he,
“I know him too well; he would scarcely have taken
an improper occasion to call me coward; I have
a better opinion of his courage than that comes to.
The other gentleman, who had talked of the oracle,
had better have said that on the last debate—but
why had he said it at all? Was it not known that
those gentlemen had courted and idolized the idol,
and had been rejected?” The debate was at length
closed by Mr. Vane,<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> who told a story of Sir Robert
Walpole and Mr. Pulteney, in the Administration
of the former. Mr. Pulteney had made a motion
for papers, and Sir Robert granted them; but immediately
went to Mr. Pulteney and told him that
what he had done would be the occasion of many
persons losing their lives, besides the mischief he
would entail on future Ministers. Mr. Pulteney
was struck, and withdrew his motion. In like manner
the order for printing was now set aside without
a division.</p>

<p>While the House of Commons was busied in continuing
to read American papers, and in other necessary
affairs of the year, various attempts were carrying
on for cementing that union between Lord Bute
and the Opposition in reality, which seemed to exist,
and in their votes did exist between them in Parliament.
I have said that the Favourite every now
and then hung out, by the intervention of his creatures,
hopes of his pardon and protection to the late
Ministers—with little sincerity, as the event showed.
Partly, I believe, his conduct was actuated by a view
of aweing the new Ministers into more deference for
him; partly to prevent the diminution of the Crown’s
authority, by relaxation towards the Americans.
Certain it is, that Colonel Graeme, the Queen’s Secretary
and much a confident, had indirectly and by
an oblique channel opened a kind of negotiation.
George Grenville, the most untractable of men, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
the most unforgiving, recoiled at the proposal; and,
even to save his darling Act, could scarce be brought
to bow the knee again to the Favourite. It was
with difficulty that he would hear of any other terms
but a dismission of the Ministers before the fatal
repeal should be passed. At length, the severe attacks
made on him in the House of Commons, and
threats of impeachments for having suppressed material
notices, relative to the dangerous situation and
humour of the Colonies, even from the year 1764,
which Lord Halifax had been ordered by the King
to lay before Parliament and had stifled, wrought on
his stubborn temper; to which were added the despotic
command of his imperious and intriguing elder
brother, who, however, had the address to wriggle
himself out of open genuflexion to the Favourite.
By the intervention of the Duke of York, Lord
Temple prevailed to have a meeting, of himself, his
brother, and the Duke of Bedford, with the Favourite,
at the house of Lord Eglinton, a Scotch emissary,
alternately devoted to the Duke of York, to
the Favourite, and to Lord Temple; at the same
time Lord of the Bedchamber to the King. Towards
the middle of January this extraordinary congress
was settled and brought to bear; though, at
the hour of meeting, Lord Temple excused himself
from attending it. The Favourite, however, had the
triumph of beholding the Duke of Bedford and
George Grenville prostrate before him, suing for
pardon, reconciliation, and support. After enjoying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
this spectacle of their humiliation for some minutes,
the lofty Earl, scarce deigning to bestow upon them
above half a score monosyllables, stiffly refused to
enter into connection with them; on which the Duke
of Bedford said, hastily, “he hoped, however, that
what had passed would remain a profound secret.”
“A secret!” replied the Favourite, “I have done
nothing I am ashamed of,—has your Grace?”—and
quitted the room. As if Lord Bute’s refusal of secrecy
made it prudent to expose even more than
Lord Bute could tell, the Duke went home, and
at dinner, with sixteen persons, and before all the
servants, he related what had passed; and then said
to the Duchess and his court, “I was against taking
this step, but you would make me.” Not nine
months had intervened between the dismission of
his brother Mackenzie by that faction, and their
abject application to the Favourite for protection.
What a trade is the politician’s, when it can so debase
the human mind! Comfort yourself, ye poor,
ye necessitous; what is the servility of your lot
compared to this of titles and riches?</p>

<p>On the 21st of February the House of Commons
came at last to the great question of the repeal of the
Stamp Act. The Opposition endeavoured to fight it
off by pretending fresh accounts were that very morning
arrived of a disposition in some of the Colonies,
particularly New York, to submit to the Act; from
whence was inferred the inutility of repealing it.
But this was properly treated as the lie of the day;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
and had no effect. General Conway moved for leave
to bring in a bill to repeal that Act; and drew an
affecting and alarming picture of the mischiefs it had
occasioned and threatened. All orders for goods from
this country were stopped: the North Americans
would neither take any more, nor pay for what they
had had. Eight merchants, who had received orders
to the amount of 400,000<i>l.</i>, had received counter-orders.
The debt to those merchants amounted to
950,000<i>l.</i> Antigua was near ruined by famine.
The tax fell chiefly on the poor, particularly on
the poor of Georgia. At home, the situation of our
manufacturers was most calamitous. Nottingham
had dismissed a thousand hands: Leicester, Leeds,
and other towns in proportion. Three in ten of
the labourers of Manchester were discharged. The
trade of England was not only stopped, but in
danger of being lost. If trade suffered, land would
suffer in its turn. Petitions would have been sent
from every trading town in England, but that they
apprehended that the very hearing of their petitions
would delay the repeal. Every part of the Act
breathed oppression. It annihilated juries: and
the Admiralty courts might drag a man three
hundred miles from his habitation. The fisheries
were in equal danger. The right of taxation he
did not doubt would be given for us in Westminster
Hall; but the conflict would ruin both
countries. We had but five thousand men in three
thousand miles of territory: the Americans an hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
and fifty thousand fighting men. If we did
not repeal the Act, he did not doubt but France and
Spain would declare war, and protect the Americans.
As the Colonies would not take our manufactures,
they would set up of their own. He had
a piece of cloth, he said, in his pocket, made at
Philadelphia, as cheap as in England. Would the
House risk the whole for so trifling an object as
this Act modified?</p>

<p>I will not detail the rest of the debate, the
essence of which had been so much anticipated.
The great, and no trifling argument on the other
side, was the danger from being beaten out of an
Act of Parliament, because disagreeable to those
on whom it fell; and the high probability that the
Americans would not stop there; but, presuming
on their own strength, and the timidity of the
English Government, would proceed to extort a
repeal of the Act of Navigation. Grenville particularly
exposed the futility of declaring a right
which the Government would not dare to exert:
and he pushed the Ministers home with giving up
the brightest jewel of the Crown, the right of taxation.
How would they justify it to his Majesty?—how
to future Administrations? Mr. Pitt, who
acknowledged his perplexity in making an option
between two such ineligible alternatives, pronounced,
however, for the repeal, as due to the
liberty of unrepresented subjects, and in gratitude
to their having supported England through three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
wars. He begged to stand a feeble isthmus between
English partiality and American violence.
He would give the latter satisfaction in this point
only. If America afterwards should dare to resist,
he would second a resolution of the most vigorous
nature to compel her with every man and every
ship in this country.</p>

<p>At half an hour past one in the morning the
committee divided, and the motion was carried by
275 to 167. This majority, though the question
was but a prelude to the repeal, decided the fate
of that great political contest. And though Lord
Rockingham with childish arrogance and indiscretion
vaunted in the palace itself that he had carried
the repeal against the King, Queen, Princess-dowager,
Duke of York, Lord Bute, the Tories, the
Scotch, and the Opposition, (and it was true he
had,) yet in reality it was the clamour of trade, of
the merchants, and of the manufacturing towns,
that had borne down all opposition.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> A general
insurrection was apprehended as the immediate
consequence of upholding the bill; the revolt of
America, and the destruction of trade, was the
prospect in future. A nod from the Ministers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
would have let loose all the manufacturers of Bristol,
Liverpool, Manchester, and such populous and
discontented towns, who threatened to send hosts
to Westminster to back their demand of repeal.
As it was, the lobby of the House, the Court of
Requests, and the avenues were beset with American
merchants. As Mr. Conway went away they
huzzaed him thrice, stopped him to thank and compliment
him, and made a lane for his passage.
When Mr. Pitt appeared, the whole crowd pulled
off their hats, huzzaed, and many followed his chair
home with shouts and benedictions. The scene
changed on the sight of Grenville. The crowd
pressed on him with scorn and hisses. He, swelling
with rage and mortification, seized the nearest
man to him by the collar. Providentially the
fellow had more humour than spleen—“Well, if
I may not hiss,” said he, “at least I may laugh,”—and
laughed in his face. The jest caught—had the
fellow been surly and resisted, a tragedy had probably
ensued.</p>

<p>On the following Monday, when the report was
to be made from the committee, Grenville’s friends,
seeing the inutility of their struggles, laboured to
persuade him to contest the matter no farther; but
it was too much to give up his favourite bill and
his favourite occupation, talking, both at once.
The last debate, too, had been much abridged by
the impatience of the committee, worn out by so
many successive discussions of the same subject.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
Many speakers had not been attended to; others
forced to sit down without being heard. Something
of this was imputed to the partiality of Rose Fuller,
the Chairman; and, before he could make his report,
Mr. Shifner ironically proposed to thank him
for his great impartiality;<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> Onslow defended, and
moved to thank him seriously. This provoked so
much, that Fuller was accused of not doing his
duty by suppressing the riots and insults offered to
several members who had voted against the repeal.
The indignities heaped on George Grenville were
particularized; and he himself said that both England
and America were now governed by the mob.
Conway quieted the dispute by declaring the pains
taken by the Administration to prevent far greater
tumults and extensive petitioning.</p>

<p>Lord Strange then proposed to postpone the
Report, that, since repeal was intended, the House
might rescind its resolution on the right of taxing,
which would be inconsistent with giving it up.
This the majority would not allow; and Dyson, on
the modifying plan, hinting that internal taxes
might be laid to ascertain the right, Lord Palmerston
said, that modifying would be giving up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
right and retaining the oppression. The Report
being then made, Oswald moved to recommit it.
Hussey showed the badness of the Act, which all
allowed, (even Grenville having offered to correct
it,) and declared the most advisable method was a
requisition to the Provinces to raise money for the
service of the Government. Norton broke out on
the resistance of the Colonies, and said, that to
resist a known law was High Treason. Huske, a
wild, absurd man, very conversant with America,
had still sense enough to show that the Americans
could not be independent, for they would be obliged
to lay an internal tax for the support of their own
paper-currency, and could not impose that tax
without the consent of Parliament. T. Townshend
referred to a letter of Governor Bernard (a great
favourite of Grenville, and warm for the sovereignty
of England) in which he had advised to get rid of
the Stamp Act. At eleven at night the recommitment
was rejected by 240 to 133; and the Bill for
Repeal was ordered to be brought in.</p>

<p>Dr. Blackstone then moved an instruction to the
committee for bringing in the bill, that all votes
of the Assemblies should be expunged that were
repugnant to the rights of the Legislature of Great
Britain. Mr. Yorke said, that an Act declaratory
of the right would be a virtual expunging of their
votes. This George Grenville treated with much
contempt, and as a mere evasion; and let loose all
his acrimony against the Ministers for reversing his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
Stamp Act. Conway said he was surprised at so
much fondness for a bill which the late Ministers
had so much neglected while they had power to
enforce it. He had been looking for the orders
they had given, and could find but one, and that
from the Treasury, settling how much poundage
should be deducted from the profits of the Stamp-duty.
This had been their only order till the 12th
of July, when they had determined to send a military
force. (This was at the conclusion of their
power.) Grenville replied, orders had been given,
for Stamp-officers had been appointed. At near two
in the morning Dr. Blackstone’s motion was rejected
without a division.</p>

<p>The Bill of Repeal was but faintly opposed in
its course, the Opposition reserving their fire for
the third reading. Wedderburne and Dyson, however,
moved to annex a clause declaratory of the
law, and enacting that in case any person or persons
should print, or cause to be printed, any paper calling
the said law in question, or abuse it in any manner
whatsoever, should be guilty of a præmunire.
The Ministers objected; and Rose Fuller, with
severe invectives on the Tories, said such a motion
would have been well-timed in the reigns of
Henry VIII. or Charles II. Wedderburne replied
by showing he had taken the words of his motion
from the Act of Settlement. The motion was rejected.</p>

<p>March 4th was fixed for passing the declaratory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
Bill of Right, and the Repeal. Mr. Pitt objected
again to the first, and avowed his opinion that the
Parliament had no right of taxing North America
while unrepresented. “He had heard,” he said,
“that this opinion had been treated in his absence
as nonsense, as the child of ignorance, as the language
of a foreigner who knew nothing of the Constitution.
Yet the common law was his guide; it
was civil law that was the foreigner.” To this he
added severe reflections on Dr. Hay, the person he
alluded to, for having adopted arbitrary notions from
the civil law. “For himself, he was sorry to have
been treated as an overheated enthusiastic leveller,
yet he had served the highest and best Prince in
Christendom, and the most valiant and brave nation,
and never would change his opinions till the day of
his death. If he was one of the weakest men in
the kingdom, at least he was one of the soberest;<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a>
had no animosities, no pursuits; he wished to live
and die a dutiful subject, and to see such an Administration
as the King should like, and the people
approve. Wales had never been taxed till represented;
nor did he contend for more than had been
given up to Ireland in the reign of King William.”
He quoted one or two authors; said he was a solitary,
unconversing man, and not a very reading man
neither; but he loved old books and old friends;
and though his books and his opinions might be
nonsensical, he should still adhere to them; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
declared he never gave his dissent with more dislike
to a question than he now gave it at present.” Dr.
Hay excused himself, and pleaded having been misrepresented;
and then he and Rigby argued for the
repeal, if it must pass, without the declaratory law.
Mr. Pitt moved to leave out the words <em>in all cases
whatsoever</em>; and the debate turned chiefly on the
resemblance or non-resemblance of Ireland to America,
in the privileges enjoyed by the former. The
amendment was rejected, and the bill passed.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></p>

<p>The Bill for Repeal was then read for the last
time, and eagerly and obstinately combated by Grenville
and his party. Bamber Gascoyne produced a
letter written to Liverpool, by Sir William Meredith,
in which the latter had said to the Mayor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
“Lord Bute’s friends, Mr. Grenville’s party and the
rank Tories, voted for this bloody question; and
considering we had been beaten twice in the House
of Lords, we were surprised to find our numbers
were 275 to 167; I hope soon to send you word of
the repeal. P. S.—Mr. Pitt will soon be at the
head of affairs.”</p>

<p>Pitt rose and said, He had heard somewhere, no
matter where—a bird in the air had told him—of a
meeting that had lately been held (between Bute,
Bedford, and Grenville) of which he could not learn
the particulars; but had heard that at that meeting
the noble Lord (Bute) behaved like himself and like
a nobleman. It was a name which had been much
bandied about in a way it did not deserve. “I am inflexibly
bent,” continued he, “to resist his return to
power; but how could that prophet (Sir W. Meredith)
imagine a thing so improbable as that I should
be at the head, when I am so extremely at the tail of
affairs, as I am now, with five friends in the other
House, and four in this? In the order and class of
salutary and preventive things, I never felt greater
satisfaction than in giving my vote for this repeal.
You could not subsist and be a people with that defalcation
of imports. America is over-glutted with
nothing but the Stamp Act. Nothing but a disposition
to heal and strengthen the Government can
make you a people. I have my doubts if there
would have been a Minister to be found who would
have dared to have dipped the royal ermines in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
blood of the Americans. This country, like a fine
horse, to use a beautiful expression of Job, whose
neck is clothed in thunder, if you soothe and stroke
it, you may do anything; but if an unskilful rider
takes it in hand, he will find that, though not vicious,
yet it has tricks. I repeat it, I never had greater
satisfaction than in the repeal of this Act.”</p>

<p>This speech gave great offence to Grenville, who
replied, “Let his bird have told him what it would,
yet, in justice to the noble Lord (Bute), he would
declare that it was impossible to behave better than
he had done; but why was that meeting mentioned?
to what end? He had heard a bird speak, too, of
a meeting, or meetings, on other occasions. But
the gentleman had doubted whether a Minister
would have been found to dip the royal ermines in
blood;—no, sir, not dip the royal ermines in blood;
but I am one who declare, if the tax was to be laid
again, I would do it; and I would do it now if I
had to choose; since he has exerted all his eloquence
so dangerously against it, it becomes doubly necessary.
It is necessary from the increase of the debt
in the late war; he knows I was against the enormous
expense of the German war. Are all those
boasted triumphs shrunk to the meanness of supporting
such a measure as this? I envy not the
popularity; let him have the bonfire; I rejoice in
the hiss. Was it to do again, I would do it.”</p>

<p>Pitt desired to say one word in answer. “What
that bird, alluded to two years ago, did say, I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
tell gentlemen. The noble Lord (Bute) came to my
lodging on a message from the King—I suppose because
I was lame—not to converse with a hermit,
but about coming into the King’s service. The noble
Lord behaved with great fairness. I had an interview;
was dismissed with the same marks of favour
by the King. Some time ago I had another meeting
with a royal person (Duke of Cumberland), who
is no more. I objected to the brother of the noble
Lord being Minister for Scotland; had no objection
to his having a sinecure. I was again dismissed
with the same graciousness by the King. But I am
charged with the expense of the German war. If the
honourable gentleman had such strong objections to
that war, why did he not resign his post of Treasurer
of the Navy?” Grenville had nothing to reply;
and in fact it ill became him to plead disapprobation
of measures in which he had concurred, rather than
resign so very lucrative an employment.</p>

<p>The repeal passed by 250 to 122. It made its
way even through the House of Lords by a majority
of more than thirty, but was followed by a strenuous
protest drawn up by Lord Lyttelton. Lord Camden
took the same part as Mr. Pitt, and declared
against the right of taxing. He also detected Lord
Mansfield, who had quoted two laws that had never
existed. As I am possessed of no notes relative to
the debates in that House, I do not pretend to
extend the detail of them. The most remarkable
event was Lord Bute’s speaking: he censured the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
timidity of the repeal, wished to see firm and able
Ministers, and denied enjoying any present influence,
and protested against accepting any future power.</p>

<p>The victorious Ministers having thus secured a
majority on the most difficult point, determined to
make use of it to alleviate other aggrieved subjects,
and to extend their own popularity. The tax on
Cider had given great uneasiness to the Western
counties, particularly from its being collected by the
mode of excise. The City of London had adopted
those disgusts; and Lord Bute, under whose Administration
the tax had been laid, had sunk beneath
the panic after he had carried the measure. To
alter that mode of collection was the next step
taken by the Ministers; and they found it no difficult
task to obtain the assent of so time-serving a
Parliament, who by turns enacted and repealed
whatever was proposed to them, and who supported
every successive Minister of that period, and deserted
him the moment he lost his power. I do not
know that other Parliaments have not, or would not
have been as bad; but no Parliament ever had so
many opportunities of being impudent. The Opposition
not well pleased with Lord Bute’s ineffectual
support, and angry that he did no more than encourage
them to oppose, were little anxious to save
the honour of his Cider Act, and the repeal of the
excise passed easily.</p>

<p>In all these debates, nothing was more marked
than the acrimony between Grenville and Conway.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
The latter appeared to be a much abler man of
business than had been expected. Mr. Dowdeswell,
on the contrary, sunk much in the estimation
of mankind, and seemed but a duller edition of
Mr. Grenville, though without his malignity. Never
did the intemperate rage of talking, which possessed
the latter, display itself more copiously than
on the debates relative to the Stamp Act. It occasioned
his being ridiculed with much humour.</p>

<p>The man who did not make long speeches, but
who absented himself on pretence of illness on
most of the debates, was Charles Townshend. He
was afraid, by speaking, of losing a place which
nothing had given, nothing could preserve, but his
speaking.</p>

<p>But though the heat of the day lay on Conway,
the power was solely engrossed by Lord Rockingham.
He admitted the Duke of Grafton and Mr.
Conway to no partnership. He was even so indiscreet
as to bestow on a relation of his own the
vacant place of Commissioner of the Revenue in
Ireland, which had been promised by Lord Hertford,
the Lord-Lieutenant, to an Irishman of note.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a>
This occasioned ill-blood between the Lord-Lieutenant,
Conway’s brother, and the head of the
Treasury. Lord Hertford, whose great property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
lay in that country, and who had always assiduously
courted the Irish, was at first very successful
there. But his economic temper, malevolently
exaggerated, and too great propensity to heap emoluments
on his children, though in few instances,
and an appearance of similitude in the disposition
of his son, Lord Beauchamp, soured the conclusion
of that Session of Parliament, and occasioned
to the Viceroy several mortifications.</p>

<p>The traverses which the English Ministers experienced,
increased every day. The King was not
only in opposition to himself, and had connived at
Lord Bute’s seducing such of his servants as were
connected with that Favourite to vote against the
measures of Government, and, in truth, those servants
were some of the ablest men in the House
of Commons, as Elliot, Dyson, Martin, and Jenkinson,
besides Sir Fletcher Norton, who, though
displaced, was at the beck of the Favourite; but
his Majesty, at Lord Bute’s recommendation,
actually bestowed a vacant regiment on Colonel
Walsh, Lieutenant-Colonel to Lord Townshend,
without saying a word of it to his Ministers. It
was not a command high enough to be offered to
General Conway. He, with singular forbearance,
had declined asking for his regiment again when
he was appointed Secretary of State, lest he should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
be taxed with rapaciousness; and yet was determined
to return to and adhere to the military
line.</p>

<p>There was another man less delicate. Lord Albemarle
had been directed by the King to act as
executor to his master, the late Duke of Cumberland.
Ambitious, greedy, and a dexterous courtier,
Lord Albemarle flattered himself that the door
was now opened to him, and sought and made
pretences from his trust to obtain frequent audiences
of the King. He procured a grant, I think,
for three lives, of the lodge at Bagshot, dependent
on Windsor, which he had held during the pleasure
of the Duke, and under colour of resigning a pension
he enjoyed on Ireland, he obtained to have it
made over to a brother and sister of his in indigent
circumstances, with whom he would otherwise
have been burthened. But here ended that
gleam of favour. Lord Bute grew jealous, and the
door of the closet was shut for ever against Lord
Albemarle.</p>

<p>Yet this and every other evidence could not open
the eyes of Lord Rockingham. He weakly flattered
himself that he was grown a personal favourite
with the King, and had undermined Lord Bute.
Nor were the complaints he was forced to make received
in a manner to nourish his delusion. When
it was first proposed to call in Mr. Pitt, the King
was said to reply, “Go on as long as you can; but
if there is to be a change, I will choose my next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
Ministers myself.” When the royal assent for
treating with Pitt had been extorted, the latter had
replied (as I have mentioned)<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> in a manner not to
inflame Lord Rockingham with eagerness to renew
the proposal. Yet the Duke of Grafton was earnest
for that junction; and disliking business, and probably
not charmed to see all power arrogated by an
associate, who was reduced to sit silent in the House
of Lords, whilst he himself was almost the sole
champion there of their joint-administration, daily
threatened to resign unless Mr. Pitt was called to
the head of affairs. Conway, under like circumstances,
looked the same way, but with more temper.
Some of the friends of the Administration,
sensible of their tottering position, and wishing to
burst the connection between Grenville and the
Bedfords, the latter of whom were the only real
supporters of the former, endeavoured to detach
the Bedfords and unite them with the Ministers;
but Rigby, devoted to Grenville, though not blind
to his defects, which he often made the subject of
his ridicule, detested Conway, and despised Lord
Rockingham and the Cavendishes, and was too
clear-sighted and too interested to attach himself
to the desperate fortune of a set of men disliked by
the King. Chance at the same time opened to the
Duke of Bedford and his friends a prospect of an
ally, able himself, and suited to their desire of
reconciliation with Lord Bute. Lord Holland’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
eldest son<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> fell in love with Lady Mary Fitzpatrick,<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a>
niece of the Duchess of Bedford, and educated by
her. The marriage was proposed, and joyfully
accepted by the Duke of Bedford, who lost not a
moment to send overtures of peace to Lord Holland.
But though the latter had consented to gratify
the inclinations of his son, as he was a most
indulgent father, he acted with the spirit of resentment
that became him; and besides rejecting the
Duke of Bedford’s offered visit, wrote him a most
severe answer, and plainly told him how egregiously
he was duped and governed by a set of worthless
people. This letter Lord Holland showed to all
that resorted to him, nor would at any time listen
to various advances that were made to him by that
family.</p>

<p>At this juncture I returned to England, April
22nd, and found everything in the utmost confusion.
The Duke of Grafton, as I have said, determined to
resign; Mr. Conway very ill, and sick of the fatigue
of his office, which he executed with inconceivable
and scrupulous attention; Lord Bute’s faction giving
no support; and the Court discouraging all men
from joining the Administration. A greater embarrassment
had fallen on the Ministers: Mr. Pitt
was grown impatient for power; and, after having
discouraged Lord Rockingham from seeking his aid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
or protection, began to wonder that he was not
courted to domineer; and he betrayed his ambition
so far as to complain that the Administration had
had his support, and now neglected him. Yet, on
Grafton’s threats of quitting the Seals, Pitt intreated
that nobody might quit for him: things were not
ripe for him; it would let in Grenville and the Bedfords,
the worst event of all, he said, for this country.
Yet, if the Ministers made any direct advances
to him, he was coy and wayward, and would treat only
with his Majesty. Lord Mansfield and Mr. Yorke,
who had great weight with Lord Rockingham, and
were both jealous of Lord Camden; and the Duke
of Richmond, now returned to England, and incited
by Lord Holland to oppose Pitt; kept alive Lord
Rockingham’s resentment, and prevented any direct
negotiation. Thus circumstanced, Pitt’s temper
broke forth. George Onslow had proposed, in
order to save fifteen or twenty thousand pounds a
year on the militia, to reduce one serjeant in each
company, and the pay of the militia-clerks from
fifty to twenty-five pounds a year. This reformation
Lord Strange opposed; and the Ministry, not thinking
it worth a division, gave it up. The opportunity,
however, was seized by Pitt, to whom the plan
had not been communicated. He went to the
House, and made a vociferous declamation against
the Ministry, who, he said, aimed at destroying the
militia; he would go to the farthest corner of the
island to overturn any Ministers that were enemies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
to the militia. This was all grimace: he did not
care a jot about the militia.</p>

<p>In a few days after this, Rose Fuller moved to
refer to the committee the petitions of the merchants
on the severe clogs laid on the American
trade. Grenville, as madly in earnest as Pitt was
affectedly so, vehemently opposed that motion, and
called it a <em>sweeping resolution</em>. They would next
attack, he supposed, the <em>sacred</em> Act of Navigation.
Burke bitterly, and Beckford and Dowdeswell, ridiculed
him on the idea of any Act being sacred if it
wanted correction. Lord Strange went farther;
said, he would speak out; should be for a free port
in America, and for altering that part of the Act of
Navigation that prohibited the importation of cotton
not the growth of our own islands.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> Charles
Townshend said he was sorry to find that convenience
was to give way to dignity. For his part he
would call for a review of the Act of Navigation.
This drew on warm altercation between him and
Grenville, in which it was no wonder that Townshend’s
wit and indifference baffled Grenville’s tediousness
and passion.</p>

<p>The idea of a free port in America had been taken
up by the Ministers, and that intention was now declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
to the hearty satisfaction of the merchants.
But this plan too, to humour Beckford’s local interests
and his own spleen to the Ministers, was
harshly and inconsiderately censured by Pitt, but
with ill-success to his popularity, the scheme being
grateful to the City. He was not more fortunate
in his next step. The Ministers thinking themselves
bound to give the last blow to General Warrants,
which had now been decided in Westminster
Hall to be illegal, moved a resolution of their
being illegal and a breach of privilege. Grenville,
hoping to squeeze out a little popularity from the
same measure, moved to bring in a bill for taking
them entirely away. This happening while
Mr. Pitt was in his hostile mood, he seconded Grenville’s
motion; but his lending himself thus to the
champion of those warrants, highly offended the
Ministerial Whigs, and drew on him much severity
from Sir George Saville and Lord John Cavendish.
Norton told Mr. Pitt privately that he had got from
Carteret Webbe Mr. Pitt’s three warrants, and
offered them to him; but Pitt refused to accept
them, and said he had always declared he would
justify his own warrants. At the same time he
dropped to him that he wondered he (Mr. Pitt) had
not understood Lord Bute’s speech on the Stamp
Act. The Opposition, to purge Lord Temple from
being the instigator of Wilkes in his attacks on the
Scotch and the Tories, now produced a letter from
the former to the latter, dissuading him from such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
national and general acrimony. This letter had
been seized among Wilkes’s papers. But if it palliated
the disposition to mischief in the one brother,
it laid open the malice of the other; and Grenville
was severely tasked for having connived at Webbe’s
suppressing this letter in enmity to his brother.
Mr. Pitt avowed to the House that he thought Carteret
Webbe gently dealt with in not being expelled.</p>

<p>The night I arrived, the Duke of Richmond came
to me to intreat Mr. Conway to go on without Mr.
Pitt, who had offended both the Administration and
the City: and he told me there were thoughts of
softening towards Lord Bute, and of suffering his
brother Mackenzie to have a place. The plan of
diverting the enmity of Lord Bute was not at all
repugnant to my opinion. From the moment the
Administration had come into place, I had seen the
necessity of it. Justice demanded the restitution of
Mackenzie. The Ministers could neither destroy the
King’s confidence in his Favourite, nor get rid of
him by force. He was in no employment, nor had
they any proofs in their hands that would authorize
impeachment. Ungrounded impeachment would
have purged him—perhaps have made him popular.
Two options only remained: to quit their places, if
they thought it for their honour not to temporize
with Bute; or to temporize with him. Why I preferred
the latter, these were the reasons: if those
Ministers surrendered their power, where was there
another set of honest men to replace them? They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
could mitigate, perhaps ward off, the evil designs of
the Court, while the executive part of government
remained in their hands. If they resigned it, it must
fall into the hands of Mr. Pitt, who must either
take his obnoxious brothers Temple and Grenville,
or lean entirely on Lord Bute; and with all my
admiration of Mr. Pitt, I doubted whether he would
not make too complacent a Minister to prerogative;
or Grenville and the Bedfords (the worst of all)
must resume their power, and they had smarted too
severely for their attacks on the Favourite, not to
have profited of that experience. The Nation had
once escaped from that coalition. Any system was
preferable to the return of it.</p>

<p>I told the Duke of Richmond, that though I
was glad to find Lord Rockingham and his friends
were grown more reasonable, yet I thought the
moment not suited to the experiment. There was
another plan which ought first to be tried, and that
was to endeavour once more, at any price, to acquire
the accession of Mr. Pitt. Should he be omitted,
it would throw him into the hands of his brothers
and the Bedfords, or of Lord Bute—perhaps of
all together. At least, should he refuse to join
with the Administration, it would put him in the
wrong, and damage his popularity, his sole strength.
Lord Rockingham came to me still more eager for
what the Duke had proposed. I adhered to my
point, though I agreed they might try to go on,
if Mr. Pitt should prove unreasonable, and Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
Conway (who was ill in the country) should not
think himself obliged to resign with the Duke of
Grafton, who had brought him into Parliament.
Grafton had promised Lord Camden (which indicated
that he acted in concert with, or by direction
of Pitt) to come to town in two days, and
resign; yet his Grace himself had been offended
at Mr. Pitt’s conduct, and had said, if he was
haughty ought of place, what would he be when in?
He should pity those who were to act under him.</p>

<p>April 25. Mr. Conway came to town, and agreed
with me on the necessity of trying Mr. Pitt once
more, though he did not think the King could
be induced to see him. On the 27th the Duke
of Grafton came to me, and Mr. Conway and I
persuaded him to defer his resignation a few
days; though he said he could not trust the King,
who had promised that Lord Bute’s faction should
support the Administration after the repeal of the
Stamp Act was passed, which during the whole
time of its discussion they had pretended they
could not come into, as they had all concurred
in the Act; yet when the repeal was over, their
conduct continued the same. This consideration
staggered Conway; and he told me, that if he
should now resign for Mr. Pitt, the latter would
certainly restore him, and entrust the House of
Commons to him, as he had declared he would.
This reflection showed Conway was more reconciled
to power than he pretended to be,—and yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
it was but transient ambition. It returned at times,
but never was permanent; and even when he had
quitted or declined supreme power, he did not give
himself less to the fatigue of business, which yet
was his standing objection. He could not enjoy
so insignificant an office as the Board of Ordnance
without making it slavery, and yet could not bear to
be Secretary of State!</p>

<p>The Duke of Grafton, however, gave notice to the
King that he would resign. The King begged him
to defer it for a few days. Thus pressed, I prevailed
with the Duke and Mr. Conway to go to Mr. Pitt,
and intreat him to give some facility to his own
accession. He complained that Lord George Sackville
had been restored to employment to affront
him personally: said he himself had been twice
admitted to treat personally with his Majesty, and
therefore hoped he might have that honour again.
Several times he threw out Grenville’s name (to intimidate),
and said he did not know what Lord Temple
would do; he had had no intercourse with him
for several months. To <em>part</em> of the Administration
he professed great civility. Mr. Conway told him
he was sure the King would not send for him. He
answered, that he looked on that as a design not to
let him come in. The fact was, the King, not desirous
of the junction of Pitt and the actual Ministers,
and choosing that Pitt should solely to him owe his
admission, pleaded that he had sent so often for Mr.
Pitt in vain, that he would condescend no more—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
resolution his Majesty was at that very time in the
intention not to keep.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May the Ministers had a meeting
at the Chancellor’s, to determine what their plan
should be on Grafton’s resignation and Pitt’s refusal;
Mr. Conway having been induced to retain
the Seals at the earnest request of the other Ministers,
rather than break up their whole Administration.
The King had ordered them to give him
their proposals in writing, expecting, at least hoping,
that they would at last propose connection with
Lord Bute. They proposed that the King should
promise to support them, and turn out those who
should not act with them; this, however, they forbore
to deliver to the King in writing. The Chancellor
said, if they determined to go on, he would
support them, but he did not think this a business
proper for the Council. Conway replied, they were
met as Ministers, and at the King’s desire. Some
were for offering a place to Mackenzie; but Newcastle
said their friends would dislike it; he had
seen several who were against it. Lord Egmont told
them fairly not to flatter themselves (and no doubt
he spoke by authority); even a place for Mackenzie
would not satisfy. Lord Bute’s friends were powerful,
and would expect confidence. They broke up
in disorder. Conway reported to the King what had
passed. He replied coldly, “I thought you would
not settle anything at one meeting.” Three days
afterwards he bade them try for support, and inquire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
if Lord Bute’s friends would not support them,
which was bidding them unite with the latter.</p>

<p>In the room of the Duke of Grafton I resolved
to try to make the Duke of Richmond Secretary
of State. Not that I could flatter myself with the
duration of the system; but as I knew the Duke
had better talents than most of the Ministers, and
would be more moderate, I thought he would be
likely to bring them to such a temper as might
prevent their dissolution then, and would be of
use to them if they remained in power. My friendship
for him made me desirous, too, to obtain that
rank for him, that, although he might enjoy it but
a very short time, he might have pretensions to
the same place, if ever they recovered their situation.
He was apt to be indolent if not employed:
the Secretary’s Seals might inspire him with more
taste for business. I first mentioned the thought
to himself, and found him pleased with it; and
then engaged him to ask Mr. Conway’s interest,
with whom I myself made it a point. Conway
liked the motion, but said he was so nearly<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> connected
with the Duke of Richmond, that he did
not care to ask it; always preferring his own character
to the service of his friends. I acted, however,
so warmly in it, and Lord Rockingham took
it up with so much kindness to the Duke, that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
surmounted Conway’s delicacy, and the Cabinet
Council proposed it to the King. His Majesty,
who had never forgiven the Duke of Richmond,
objected strongly to that choice; said the Duke
was too young (though as old as Grafton), and
desired it might be first tried if Lord Hardwicke
would not accept the Seals. Lord Hardwicke, a
bookish man, conversant only with parsons, ignorant
of the world, and void of all breeding, was
as poor a choice as could have been made; and
being sensible himself that he was so, declined
the offer; yet to avoid taking Richmond, and to
keep within the circle of Lord Rockingham’s friends,
his Majesty next proposed to make the Attorney-General,
Yorke, Secretary of State. If the elder
brother was ill-qualified for that office, the younger
was still more so, being ignorant of languages
and of Europe, and read in nothing but the learning
of his profession. Lord Rockingham, as civil
as the King, yielded to make this trial too; but
at the same time told the King that he and
his friends, finding the precariousness of their situation,
wished to resign their employments. The
King begged they would not, said he should be
greatly distressed, and had nobody to replace them.
Yorke declining the Seals, they were at last bestowed
on the Duke of Richmond, who in answer
to the notification he received from Lord Rockingham,
marked his being sensible how little he had
been his Majesty’s choice. He entered, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
on his office with all the ardour and industry that
I had expected, and had every qualification to make
him shine in it. He had such unblemished integrity,
and so high a sense of his duty and honour,
that in the preceding winter Lord Powis<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> having
been exposed in the House of Lords for sordid
meanness and injustice to Lady Mary Herbert,<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a>
the sister of the last Marquis, from whose bounty
Lord Powis had received his estate, and yet withheld
from her a scanty annuity, the Duke of
Richmond consulted the Chancellor to know if there
was no precedent of expelling a Peer, so little was his
Grace possessed by what is called <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l’esprit de corps</i>.</p>

<p>But though the Seals were given to the Duke
of Richmond, several other places of importance
and rank remained vacant; nor could any man be
found that would accept them, being discouraged
by the discountenance with which the King treated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
his Ministers. Nor did it stop there; Lord Howe<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a>
resigned his post, declaring he could not co-operate
unless Mr. Pitt was Minister, an extraordinary
strain of delicacy in a man who had accepted a
commission at the Board of Admiralty from Mr.
Grenville on the fall of Mr. Pitt, and his new post
from the present Ministers on the fall of Mr. Grenville.
Yet when the Ministers represented to the
King the disgrace it brought upon his Government
to have so many employments lie unfilled, and even
offered to make Mr. Mackenzie Vice-treasurer of
Ireland, his Majesty declined that place for him,
but advised them to get all the strength they could.
Lord Bute’s friends owned that it was expected the
Ministers should employ their faction, in particular
the Earl of Northumberland and Sir Fletcher Norton.
The last none of them would hear of; and
even I, who for the reasons I have given, wished
them not to proscribe a party without whom they
could not be Ministers, advised them to resign
rather than stoop to adopt so bad a man, so lately,
to their credit, cashiered by themselves. In truth,
there was nothing but obstinacy in some, and irresolution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
in others. The nearer their fall, the
more Lord Rockingham grew inclined to preserve
his power by humouring the King; while Lord
John Cavendish was inflexible to Bute, and Mr.
Conway totally irresolute what part to take.</p>

<p>Not so the Court faction. Dyson opposed the
tax on windows, and yet the Opposition was beaten
by four to one. When the bill passed the Lords,
the Duke of Grafton expressed great regard for some
of the Ministers; but the nation, he said, called for
the greatest abilities, and for all abilities; and
though himself had borne a general’s staff, he would
with pleasure take up a mattock and spade to be
of what use he could. The Duke of Bedford
forced Lord Rockingham to rise and say a few
words.</p>

<p>It was now the 29th of May. From the instant
of my arrival I had pressed the Ministers to put an
end to the session, and had foretold that they would
let it draggle on till it overturned them. All my
views tended to prevent their resigning before the
Parliament rose, and to keep them in place till the
eve of the next session; that if no circumstances
should arise in their favour during that interval,
they might surprise and distress the King by a
sudden resignation, or force him to give them better
terms. Should they quit in the present conjuncture,
whatever grievances they might allege
would be forgotten before six months were elapsed.
My prophecy, though founded, was as little regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
as my advice. Late as it was, a new parliamentary
business, waited on by new scruples of Mr.
Conway, broke forth.</p>

<p>On the death of the late Duke of Cumberland
it had been projected to divide his 25,000<i>l.</i> a year
between the King’s three brothers, and make up
the revenue of each 20,000<i>l.</i> a year. The Ministers,
during Mr. Conway’s illness in the country, had
consented to carry this through, without acquainting
him. When he came to town he vehemently
objected to it, as the session was so near its period.
The Cavendishes caught the scruple, and infused it
into Lord Rockingham, though he had passed his
word for it to the King. The Chancellor and Lord
Egmont were as eager on the other hand to have
the promise performed, and the former had warm
words with Conway. The King was much discomposed,
and said, unless his brothers would give it up
he could not. The Duke of Gloucester, all decency
and temper, behaved handsomely; but the Duke of
York, instigated by the Bedfords, insisted on what
had been promised to him. Lord Rockingham told
the King he would keep his word, but would then
resign—that was, would keep a promise he had neglected
till it was almost too late, but then would
resign for having kept it. Mr. Conway said he
could not vote for it, but would absent himself from
the House. Lord Rockingham repented the instant
he had made his declaration, but did not
know how to get off. Mr. Conway consulted me on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
this dilemma, and objected that Mr. Grenville was
out of town, thinking the business of the session at
an end. “What!” said I, “because you suffered
Mr. Grenville to protract the session till he had
wearied even himself, is that a reason for the Ministers
not performing what they have engaged for?
You have just had a signal victory [on the tax], and
now will give up all for an idle qualm. For God’s
sake satisfy the King and the Princes on this point;
but you are so unfit to be Ministers, that I advise
you to find some plausible and popular excuse afterwards
to resign;” and to that indeed now did my
utmost wishes tend. I saw they must fall, and desired
only that the pretence might do them credit.
At night, however, I hit off an expedient to which
I got the concurrence of the Ministers. It was to
propose to the King that they should move for a call
of the House. <em>That</em> would take up at least a fortnight,
and near as much time to go through the bill.
He was to be told how unpopular the service was. If
he still accepted the call, the question would either
be carried in a full House, which would justify the
Ministers; or would be lost in a full House, which, besides
defeating the measure, would punish the Duke
of York, without affording room of censure against
the Ministers, as the Opposition would support the
Duke; and the question, if lost, would be lost by
the defection of the Court’s own majority, to whom
the measure was very unpalatable, from the largeness
of the designed appanages, and the independence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
of the Crown which the Princes would acquire.
If, on the other hand, the King should refuse to
accept the call, the Ministers would be in some
degree disculpated from keeping their promise, or
would have more grace in resigning. The Ministers
went with this proposal to the King, but he had
now prevailed on his brother of York to give up the
point till the next session, on promise that the half-year’s
income, which he would lose by the delay,
should be made up to him.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of June Rigby moved that the Parliament
should not be prorogued, but kept sitting
by short adjournments to wait for news from America.
This was easily overruled; and then a message
from the Crown was delivered, asking a portion
for the Princess Caroline against her marriage
with the King of Denmark. Dyson, in opposition
to the Ministers (and for a treacherous reason that
will presently appear), offered a precedent against
taking the message into consideration but in the
committee or the next day—a strange disrespect,
unless it had been concerted with the King. This
occasioned a long debate, and Conway greatly distinguished
himself by his spirit and abilities; and
Dyson’s motion was rejected by 118 to 35. Next
came a message for a settlement on the Princess.
Augustus Hervey<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> proposed to amend the address,
and to promise to take it into immediate consideration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
This, too, was outvoted; and Charles Townshend
spoke finely on the occasion, with great encomiums
on the Duke of Grafton and Conway.</p>

<p>The next day the Ministers pressed the King to
turn out Dyson and Lord Eglinton, who had voted
against the tax. His Majesty hesitated, but desired
Lord Rockingham to talk to them. Lord Rockingham
saw Dyson for an hour, who pretended to be in
no opposition, but to dislike measures; and going
through them showed he disliked every one of their
measures. On this Lord Rockingham again proposed
his being turned out, but the King took
time to consider.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> Mr. Conway spoke to me on
this. I said, it was plain Lord Bute meant to force
them to join him, which made it impossible for them
to join him; yet I begged they would not opiniatre
those dismissions, as it would not be proper for
them to resign on Court intrigues. To resign because
men were not turned out would be still less
proper in them, who had complained so much of
dismissions, though the case was widely different
between being persecuted for conscience sake, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
dismissing men who would force them to unite with
the very arbitrary Ministers they had condemned.
They must wait till they were obstructed in some
constitutional measure, and then retire.</p>

<p>Lord Hertford<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> was now returned from Ireland,
and prevailed on his brother to consent that Mackenzie
should be restored to his ancient place, as
soon as any settlement could be made to open it for
him; and to let Lord Northumberland go ambassador
to Paris, if Lord Rochford could be otherwise
accommodated. The Duke of Richmond and
Lord Rockingham came into this, and it was broken
to the King in general terms. “Was there anybody
he wished to prefer?” He was on his guard,
and replied, “No;” that they might not accuse him
of parting with them on their rejection of any of
Lord Bute’s creatures. They then again mentioned
Dyson and their own weakness; and showed him an
intercepted letter of the Russian Minister to his
Court, in which he wished his mistress not to conclude
too hastily with the present Ministers, who
could not maintain their ground: and he pointed
out the damage the King brought on his own affairs
by having a Ministry who did not enjoy his confidence.
This the King denied, and said they had
his confidence. For Dyson, he had opposed Princess
Caroline’s portion, and his Majesty did not care to
remove anybody on his own account (a salvo, as I
have said, concerted). Dyson, they replied, opposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
and obstructed all measures at the Board of Trade.
Still the King would not give him up, but promised
he would the next winter, if Dyson did not alter his
conduct; but his Majesty had determined to remove
the Ministers, not Dyson. Lord Eglinton was next
accused of having opposed the tax. “Oh!” said
the King, “that is abominable; but Eglinton is
angry with me too: he says I have not done
enough for him.” They civilly put his Majesty in
mind that he had promised, in the middle of the
winter, to dismiss opponents on their next default;
but the plea was taken, and nothing could be obtained
by the Ministers for their satisfaction.</p>

<p>The Chancellor, Lord Northington, disgusted with
the dilatoriness and irresolution of the Ministers;
and seeing they would neither embrace the Favourite,
nor could do without him; and perceiving,
too, that the King was determined to suffer them on
no other terms than compliance, was alarmed for
his own interest; and apprehending that if Mr.
Pitt, as was probable he would, became the Minister,
Lord Camden would expect the Seals, made a
pretence of quarrelling with the Ministers, complaining
most untruly that he was not consulted nor
summoned on cases,<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> which had not only been submitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
to him, but had waited for him and suffered
by his delay. All this, however, being but negative,
the Chancellor wished to have more positive
merit, and accordingly told the King (and possibly
had his Majesty’s own orders for telling him so)
that this Ministry could not go on, and that his
Majesty must send for Mr. Pitt. Whether this
meanness was officious, or whether instilled into
him, was not certainly known. The motion was
at least so acceptable that the Chancellor certainly
opened a new negotiation with Mr. Pitt. Lord
Bute’s friends asserted solemnly that this treaty,
which was kept very secret, was known only to his
Majesty, and concluded without the least privity of
the Favourite—a tale too improbable to meet with
the least credit.</p>

<p>As a signal of what was to ensue, on the 7th of
July the Chancellor went in to the King, and declared
he would resign; a notification he had not
deigned to make to the Ministers, but which he
took care they should know, by declaring openly
what he had done. When the Ministers saw the
King, he said coolly, “Then I must see what I
can do.”<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
The next day the Duke and Mr. Conway came
to me in the country to ask my opinion on the
present crisis. I said, I believed it was the signal
of a change, but as it was yet uncertain whether
the Chancellor had acted from self-interested fear,
or by concert with the King, the wisest step for
the Ministers would be to seize the opportunity,
and on Wednesday, the next Court-day, (it being
now Monday,) resign their places very civilly on
want of the King’s confidence, and recommend to
his Majesty to send for Mr. Pitt. This, if the
King was not prepared with a Ministry, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
greatly distress him; and whether Pitt, or Grenville,
or the Bedfords were sent for, they would
give harder terms to Lord Bute when at their
mercy. That <em>their</em> recommending Pitt might prevent
the King’s sending for him; and then nothing
would be so odious and unpopular as the Bedford
faction united with Bute, while Pitt and the present
Ministers should be out of place. That if
Pitt did become Minister, he would be hampered
by <em>their</em> recommendation; it would hurt his popularity
if he did not take them in, and must be
an obstacle to his preferring the Bedfords. I added
that this recommendation would be entirely consistent
with Mr. Conway’s past declarations, which
had always been in favour of Mr. Pitt, and would
bind the Duke of Grafton more firmly to Conway.
This advice was extremely tasted by Mr. Conway,
not at all by the Duke, who had no partiality for
Mr. Pitt.</p>

<p>The next day the Duke wrote to argue the
point with me, and said, Lord Rockingham was
still for making Yorke Chancellor, for insisting on
the dismission of Dyson, Eglinton, Augustus Hervey,
and others, and then for offering the King
to make Mr. Mackenzie Vice-treasurer of Ireland.
This last (which had already been in effect rejected)
the Duke allowed was a very silly plan, but thought
Mr. Pitt had treated the Ministers with too much
contempt to make it honourable for them to propose
him; the Duke even supposed that their not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
leaving the King in distress would oblige him.
Mr. Conway, he said, was determined to follow
my advice. I, who had no opinion of his Majesty’s
sensibility or gratitude, stuck to what I had said;
and warned the Duke to take care that they were
not turned out in the cause of Yorke, instead of
their own. I advised his Grace to make use of
the good news from America, where all was quiet,
and to declare that having pacified America, they
could now resign without reproach; but the Seals
had glimmered in Yorke’s eyes, and I knew he
would advise any meanness rather than lose the
moment of being Chancellor.</p>

<p>I went to town on Wednesday the 7th, in the
afternoon, concluding that Rockingham and Newcastle
would have prevailed on Mr. Conway to defer
resigning for a day or two. So it had happened,
though the Duke of Richmond had been convinced
by me that they must resign. But in the morning,
when the Ministers had gone in to the King,
his Majesty, with the most frank indifference, and
without even thanking them for their services, and
for having undertaken the Administration at his
own earnest solicitation, acquainted them severally
that he had sent for Mr. Pitt; and lest this declaration
should want a comment, to Newcastle he said,
“I have not two faces.” Newcastle replied, “Does
your Majesty know if Mr. Pitt will come?” “Yes,”
said the King, “I have reason to think he is disposed
to come;” and then added, “I wish you all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
well, particularly Lord Rockingham.” Nothing
could be harsher to Newcastle, in whose presence
this was uttered. To the Duke of Richmond the
King was not tolerably civil; and, in truth, I believe
the Seals which I had obtained for his Grace
were a mighty ingredient towards the fall of that
Administration. To Conway alone his Majesty was
gracious, and told him he hoped never to have an
Administration of which he should not be one.
This looked as if the plan was settled, and that
the King knew Mr. Pitt intended to retain Conway,
for his Majesty loved him no better than the
rest; and at Lord Rochford’s return from Spain
had ridiculed Conway’s despatches, and said, he
fancied Lord Rochford had had difficulty to know
how to act, as they were sometimes warm, sometimes
cold. This remark had been furnished by
the Chancellor, when the offer made by the King
of Spain of taking the King of Prussia for arbitrator
on the money due for the ransom of the
Manillas, had neither been accepted nor rejected.
When the King told Conway he had sent for
Pitt, he replied, “Sir, I am glad of it; I always
thought it the best thing your Majesty could do.
I wish it may answer: Mr. Pitt is a great man;
but as nobody is without faults, he is not unexceptionable.”</p>

<p>On the 11th Mr. Pitt arrived; and on the 13th
Mr. Conway came to me, and told me Mr. Pitt
had been with him, had shown much frankness,
and had offered him the Seals again, and the lead
in the House of Commons, for he himself could
not attend there. The King, Mr. Pitt said, had
sent for Lord Temple; and he himself must offer
him the Treasury, but protested it was without
knowing whether he would accept it. Of Mr.
Grenville it was delicate for him to speak; but if
Mr. Conway would not conduct the House of Commons,
Mr. Grenville must, though that would be
subject to great difficulties. He intended something
for Mr. Mackenzie when occasion should
offer; thought Lord Bute had been too much proscribed,
but would ever resist his having power.
Changes he wished could be made without changes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
The foundation of the present Ministry he hoped
would remain; but he must take care of Lord Camden,
Lord Shelburne, Lord Bristol, and Colonel Barré.
Of Lord Rockingham he thought meanly, but was
sorry to displace him. Sorry, too, for the Duke of
Richmond; would he take an embassy? Mr. Conway
said, No. Pitt replied, he did not desire
an immediate answer; he knew Mr. Conway would
have difficulties. Conway avowed he had the
greatest, though two months before he should have
laughed at any man that had supposed he could
have any. He should now prefer returning to the
military; but would consult his friends.</p>

<p>The same moment that told me Mr. Conway’s
acceptance would be an exclusion of George Grenville,
decided my opinion; and the Duke of Richmond
coming in at that instant, we related what
had passed, and I frankly told the Duke, that I
could not hesitate on pressing Mr. Conway to accept,
when I knew it would be shutting the door
against George Grenville. The Duke heard my
opinion with concern; and with great decency to
Conway, rather started objections than urged him
to decline. It would break the party; Mr. Pitt,
as well as Lord Bute, had always aimed at dividing
all parties. Could Mr. Conway quit the
Cavendishes? I told his Grace, that if Mr. Pitt
did not remain in the House of Commons, which
he seemed disposed to quit, Mr. Conway would be
the Minister. The latter I was sure would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
go into opposition. His excluding Grenville would
exclude Lord Temple. Lord Hertford arrived: and
desiring for his own sake, that Mr. Conway should
go on as much as I desired it, from enmity to
Grenville, and Conway himself inclining to go on,
he easily acceded to our opinion. But in honour
of the Duke of Richmond, I must add, that he was
so satisfied with my plain dealing, however vexed
at the event, that he neither then, <em>nor ever after</em>,<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a>
changed his countenance towards me or confidence;
and was the only man I ever knew, whose friendship
difference in party had no power to shake.
As he was the sole person of that party for whom
I had any friendship myself, I pressed Mr. Conway
to ask for the Duke a promise of the Garter
and of the Blue Guards; but that measure was defeated
by the warmth of the heads of the party,
provoked by the neglect Pitt showed them; though
in truth, they were forward enough in inviting his
resentment, by pressing all their friends to resign,
even if Lord Temple should come in without Grenville.</p>

<p>On the 14th arrived Lord Temple, who, at Mr.
Pitt’s earnest desire, had been sent for by the King.
Mr. Pitt, who always acted like a Minister retired
or retiring from power, rather than as an all-puissant,
or new Minister, had begun to refine on his
former conduct: and had already commenced that
extraordinary scene of seclusion of himself, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
he afterwards carried to an excess that passed,
and no wonder, for a long access of phrenzy. It
was given out that he had a fever, and he retired
to Hampstead, whither Lord Temple went and saw
him the day of his arrival. The next day Lord
Temple had an audience of the King. On the 16th
he was with Mr. Pitt till seven in the evening,
dined, and took the air with him, when such high
words passed, that the coachman overheard their
warmth, and Mr. Pitt was so much agitated that
his fever increased, and he would see nobody, not
even the Duke of Grafton, whom he had sent for
to town, but whom he had informed by message that
he would take no step without acquainting his Grace.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></p>

<p>On the 17th Lord Temple again saw the King,
made extravagant demands, which were peremptorily
refused, and immediately went out of town.</p>

<p>The detail was, that Mr. Pitt had pressed the
King to send for him; but said that was all he
asked. When he and Lord Temple met, the latter
insisted on bringing in his brother George; Mr.
Pitt would not hear of it. Lord Temple then demanded
that Lord Lyttelton should be President of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
the Council: nor that would Mr. Pitt grant: nor,
in truth, did Lord Temple propose any conditions
in earnest after the negative put upon his brother.
Then, indeed, as provision for loading Mr. Pitt, Lord
Temple asked him what he intended to do about
Mr. Mackenzie and Lord Northumberland. He
replied, Considerably. This was of a piece with
what Lord Temple had lately done. In a pamphlet
published by Almon, to abuse the Ministry, and
called “The History of the late Minority,” it was
declared that Lord Temple’s refusal of coming in
with Mr. Pitt in the preceding year, had been
grounded on the terms Mr. Pitt had been willing
to grant to Lord Northumberland. As that refusal
fully justified Mr. Pitt from not calling Lord Temple
again, it was strange refinement or delicacy to
invite a new quarrel by a new summons, especially
as it was evident that he did not mean to grant
any one facility that could tempt Lord Temple to
accept.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></p>

<p>Fortunate it was, that Lord Temple did not overreach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
him by accepting. It was not less fortunate
that he remained out of place, a check on Lord
Bute, and a sure source of clamour against arbitrary
measures, while discontented himself.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> Yet Lord
Temple did not act without art. Though the King
saw, from the first five minutes of their conversation,
that he did not mean to accept the Treasury, yet he
and his brother had persuaded the Bedfords that he
intended it, and that he would bring them in; and
extremely were they disappointed when they heard
the negotiation was at an end; but it had answered
the purpose of his laying them under obligation to
his intentions, especially as he endeavoured to make
them believe that he had broken with Mr. Pitt for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
refusing to make him<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> Secretary of State; but the
Bedfords, who could get over real obligations, were
not men to be much enchained by fictitious intentions.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></p>

<p>Mr. Conway laboured to make some accommodation
between Mr. Pitt and the fallen Ministers;
and to engage the former to try at softening the ill-humour
of the latter, who were great and respectable
men, and whose assistance he would want.
Pitt was cold and mysterious; said it would be impertinent
in him to inform any of them that they
were to be dismissed; it must come from his Majesty
in the ordinary way of office. He should go
to the King on the morrow; nothing was yet settled;
he should begin with the great outlines. The
Army and Law, he thought, should be left to the
King. Lord Granby was very high; but if his
Majesty preferred Lord Albemarle, he should not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
oppose it. Charles Yorke he should leave Attorney-General,
unless the King disliked him.</p>

<p>The same day Mr. Pitt wrote to Charles Townshend
in this haughty and laconic style:—“Sir, you
are of too great a magnitude not to be in a responsible
place: I intend to propose you to the
King to-morrow for Chancellor of the Exchequer,
and must desire to have your answer to-night by nine
o’clock.” Unprecedented as this method was of
imposing an office of such confidence in so ungracious
a manner (for it was ordering Townshend
to accept 2700<i>l.</i> a year in lieu of 7000<i>l.</i>, and intimated
that, accepting or refusing, he must quit the
post of Paymaster), yet it was singularly well
adapted to the man. It was telling him that no
other man in England was so fit for that difficult
employment; and it was telling him at the same
time that though his great abilities rendered him
an useful servant, the lightness of his character
made those talents not formidable in an enemy.</p>

<p>Pitt had judged rightly. Townshend did not
dare to fling both offices in his face: but, without
being incensed or flattered, fell into the most ridiculous
distress imaginable. All he felt was the
menace, and the loss of the Paymaster’s place; and
instead of concealing the affront or his own anxiety,
he sat at home in his night-gown, received all that
came, showed Pitt’s mandate to them, and commented
on it, despatched messengers for his brother
and the Duke of Grafton, who were out of town;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
and as the time lapsed, ran to the window on every
coach that passed, to see if they were arrived. At
last he determined on suing for leave to remain
Paymaster, to which Pitt listened. Then with his
usual fluctuation, Townshend repented of not accepting
the Chancellorship of the Exchequer, so
leading a situation in the House of Commons, and
begged he might have it. Pitt replied, The place
was full, being then inclined to retain Mr. Dowdeswell.
Townshend renewed his supplication with
tears; but for some time Pitt was firm. At length
he yielded to the Duke of Grafton’s intercession;
and that very day Townshend told the King that
Mr. Pitt had again pressed and persuaded him to
be Chancellor of the Exchequer—with such silly
duplicity did he attain a rank which he might have
carried from all competitors, had his mind borne
any proportion to the vastness of his capacity. Pitt
diverted himself with these inconsistencies, and suffered
him to be his Chancellor.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></p>

<p>But now Pitt’s own mind, as unballasted by judgment
as Townshend’s, though expressing itself in
loftier irregularities, disclosed to Grafton and Conway
his plan of Administration. He told them
he meant to make the present Administration the
groundwork of his own, and meditated few changes;
that Lord Camden<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> was to be Chancellor, and Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
Northington President: that he had asked the
King what his Majesty desired for Mackenzie.
The King had answered, Restoration, but without
power in Scotland; to which he had consented.
Something for Lord Northumberland—but he
might wait. Lord Bristol was to be Lord-Lieutenant
of Ireland, when Lord Hertford should be
weary of it. The Duke of Grafton was to be
placed at the head of the Treasury, with Dowdeswell
(on Townshend’s refusal) for Chancellor of the
Exchequer: Lord Shelburne and Mr. Conway,
Secretaries of State; Colonel Barré and James
Grenville, Vice-Treasurers of Ireland; Lord George
Sackville to be turned out. At last he acquainted
them that himself was to be Privy Seal and a peer.</p>

<p>Two words are sufficient comments on so ill-conceived
and ill-digested a plan. It was founded on
a set of men whose chiefs he disgusted and displaced,
without having obtained, without having
even asked the consent or sounded the acquiescence
of those who were to remain, and whose passions
he had left to be worked upon by their several
leaders: and, as if forgetting that the sole foundation
of his own authority lay in his ascendant in
the House of Commons, and in his popularity, he
abandoned the one and risked the other; vainly
presuming that he could dictate from the House
of Peers, where he had no interest, and which required
far different oratory from that in which his
strength lay. Some argument, much decency, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
great art are requisite to lull and lead Lords. The
House of Commons, too, was so accustomed to see
the Minister himself at their head, as not to be
easily conducted by his substitutes. It was quitting
the field to Grenville and every rising genius.
Even his own Chancellor of the Exchequer, when
not under his own lash, was almost sure to run
riot. Two such capital errors in the outset, could
not but embarrass his measures: they did; and yet
smaller errors had greater consequences.</p>

<p>The outlines of the plan were no sooner public
than they gave the highest offence to those whom
it most imported Mr. Pitt to keep in humour. The
King owned to Mr. Conway that he much disliked
Lord Shelburne. The Ministerial Whigs, or party
of the late Ministers, were enraged. Rockingham
was indignant at being displaced for Grafton, and
Richmond for Shelburne; and was the more hurt
that Mr. Conway suffered this preference. He
complained to me of Conway with much anger.
I said, “I could not allow Mr. Conway to be
blamed, in order to disculpate myself. I did profess
I had advised him, as his Grace knew, to accept
Mr. Pitt’s offers. He had accepted them before
any mention had been made of Shelburne; and
grievous as it was to him, could he break on it
with Mr. Pitt, after being the cause that the latter
had broken with both his brothers, Temple and
Grenville? Mr. Conway had wished to resign with
his friend the Duke of Grafton; yet had stayed in at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
the request of the whole party, as they could not
go on without him. Could they blame him for
staying in now, when the Duke of Grafton returned
to Administration?” The Duke replied, “The
Duke of Grafton had treated Mr. Conway ill;
and that his obligations were to the House of
Cavendish.” I said, “My Lord, was the 5000<i>l.</i>
bequeathed to him by the late Duke of Devonshire
to be a retaining fee to make him a servant
to that family?” The Duke asked, why Mr.
Pitt did not turn out any of Lord Bute’s friends?
Why only friends of the late Ministers? I said,
“Not one had been or would be turned out
for Lord Bute’s friends: that no man of half the
importance of Mr. Pitt had ever brought so few
dependents; he had proposed but four of any consequence,
the Duke of Grafton, Lord Camden, Lord
Shelburne, and Lord Bristol; and even the last
he waived for a time. That himself declared he
acceded to the present Administration, not they
to him; and that he brought not a single man
along with him, that had not voted with them
all the last winter. That Mr. Conway was influenced
by measures, not by men; yet these were
both Whig men and Whig measures. Oppose the
first arbitrary measure, my Lord, you and your
friends, and you will be in the right; but hitherto
of what can you complain? Three weeks ago
you declared you could not meet the opening of
the next Session. The Administration has now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
got the most creditable accession and strength,
and will not accept it:” at last I said, “Desire
Mr. Conway, my Lord, not to accept, and I will
answer he will not.” “No,” said the Duke, with
his usual goodness of heart, “I will not do that.”
“Then,” said I, “my Lord, your Grace and your
friends will reduce Mr. Conway to this; he will be
disgusted with your ill-treatment, he will ask for
his regiment again, and retire, and never enter the
House of Commons more; and then what becomes
of your party?” The Duke was infinitely struck
with this; and though for a few days he could
not conceal his dissatisfaction from Conway on the
latter’s yielding to let him be removed for Shelburne,
his friendly heart surmounted his chagrin,
and he wrote a letter to Conway acknowledging
that he had been in the wrong, and renewing their
amity.</p>

<p>In truth, I suffered as much as the Duke in being
forced to argue against him, when my heart was on
his side. But nothing could have justified Conway
in flying off after Pitt had sacrificed Grenville to
him, and all other views of support. Every public
consideration concurred to excite my endeavours,
that Pitt and the late Administration should not
separate. <em>They</em> were honest, and <em>he</em> inflamed with
the love of national glory. All <em>they</em> wanted was
activity and authority; <em>he</em> was proper to confer
both. If he lost <em>them</em>, he must hang on Bute,
or revert to his brothers and the Bedfords. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
and the late Ministers were popular; all other sets
were odious from past experience of their actions.</p>

<p>In vain did I labour to preserve so salutary an
union. My evil genius, Lord John Cavendish, came
across me; and though I had the private satisfaction
of letting him see whose influence with Mr.
Conway was the greater; it did not compensate for
the mischief he did by inflaming the party against
Pitt. To engage by his example to set Pitt at defiance,
Lord John resigned his seat at the Treasury;
and lest he should be too much in the right
by resenting the ill-treatment of his friends, he sent
his resignation to the Duke of Grafton in a letter,
in which he told the Duke that he supposed his
Grace did not desire to see a Cavendish at that
board. Nothing could be more unfounded or unjust
than this insinuation. Grafton had ever lived
in the utmost harmony with that family, and Lord
John was his particular friend. There was no intention
of removing one of their relations; and the
Duke had, above all, reckoned on Lord John for his
associate in the Treasury. Yet the latter affected
to beg nobody to resign—after firing the signal.
He carried this dissimulation so far as to beg me,
who felt the blow he had let fall on Conway, to do
my utmost that Lord Dartmouth and Mr. Dowdeswell
might be pacified, or they would both resign:
and he concluded his exhortation with great professions
to the Duke of Grafton, who, he said, had
always distinguished him from the time he was at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
school. I said, “I was sorry, but did not see
what I could do: that they would drive Mr. Pitt to
Lord Bute, or to his brothers and the Bedfords.”
“No,” he replied, “it might drive Mr. Pitt himself
away, which would make confusion, and confusion
did no harm in times of peace.” “That confusion,”
said I, “would unite Lord Bute and the Bedfords.”
“Oh!” said he, “then we should have impeachments.”</p>

<p>Slight as our hopes were now of working any
good on the party, Mr. Conway was urgent with
Pitt to show them some civilities, and represented
how much they were exasperated by his obstinate
silence and coldness. Pitt said, he heard so, but
could not believe it: all would come right again.
Conway implored him to speak to them, or to empower
him to soothe them. He was inflexible:
said, the King did all. When done, he would go
to Lord Rockingham; but would promise no further.
Conway spoke of the Duke of Portland,<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a>
who, as nearly related to the Cavendishes, must be
disposed to quit, and therefore required the more
attention; and, as the last argument, stated the
cruelty of his own situation. Nothing could move
him. He replied coldly, If Portland should resign,
he would be replaced by a man taken from no
exceptionable quarter. This looked like no unwillingness
to disgust; and though this absurdity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
trampling on the greatest subjects, and even on
those men on whose support he must lean, or leave
himself at the mercy of the Court, was not abhorrent
from Pitt’s character notwithstanding the inconveniencies
it had often drawn on him; yet I
have suspected that at the time in question, he
might have studied or received intimations of the
King’s inclination to get rid of some particular
men. The Cavendishes had long been particularly
obnoxious, had personally affronted the Princess
on the Bill of Regency, and had been the chief
obstructors of any approach to Lord Bute. The
Duke of Portland, though his mother<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> was the
intimate friend of Lady Bute, had wantonly piqued
himself on enmity to the Favourite; and by local
and county<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> circumstances was the declared rival in
the North of Sir James Lowther,<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> the Favourite’s
son-in-law. To these motives was added in Pitt a
desire of making room for Lord Bristol; and an
incidental offer to himself of support from another
quarter contributed to augment his indifference to
the consequences of the party’s anger.</p>

<p>It happened that the Bedford squadron did not
give credit to the fair report Lord Temple had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
made of his zeal for their service. Their hopes
had been raised, and seeing a door open, they were
not willing to be excluded by an equivocal obligation.
Lord Tavistock<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> acquainted the Duke of
Grafton, that his father disclaimed the Grenvilles,
and would be ready to assist his Grace on no other
conditions than places for Lord Gower, Rigby, and
Vernon,<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> the Duchess’s brother-in-law. This was
making so capital a breach in that connection on
such moderate terms, that averse as I was to the
Bedfords, I wished to see it closed with before
they should be apprized of the ill-blood between
Pitt and the late Ministers. But if the offer
swelled Pitt’s haughtiness, it did not operate much
on the prudence of his measures. He at once
slighted the overture, and continued his obstinacy
of making no overtures to the discontented. It
seemed a contest between them which should be
most in the wrong. Lord Rockingham and his
friends professed that they would yet be contented
with civilities. Lord Frederick and Lord John
Cavendish both sounded this high; and the latter,
at my house, pressed Mr. Conway so much to
obtain some notice of them from Mr. Pitt, that
he went that very evening to the latter, and did
at last prevail with him to visit Lord Rockingham.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
Mr. Pitt went the next morning, and was
admitted into the house, but was met by a servant,
who said, his Lord desired to be excused from
seeing him. Thus had they forced Mr. Conway
to draw in Mr. Pitt to receive an affront; and
from that day the wound was incurable.</p>

<p>On the 30th of the month Mr. Pitt kissed hands
for the Privy Seal, and the Earldom of Chatham;
Grafton, Camden, Northington, and Charles Townshend
for the places I have mentioned. Lord
Howe was restored to his post of Treasurer of
the Navy; Barré and James Grenville were made
Vice-Treasurers of Ireland; and Lord George Sackville
was dismissed.</p>

<p>The same day Lord Dartmouth resigned the
Board of Trade, and Charles Yorke his post of
Attorney-General. Dowdeswell was asked what he
should like: he replied, the King had placed him
above what he had pretensions to, but having been
there he could take nothing lower. Though in
straitened circumstances and burthened with a numerous
offspring, he adhered to his party, and refused
to be First Lord of Trade, or Half-Paymaster.
His character was exceedingly fair; but among
many examples of that time, he had been raised
above his abilities, and was more respected for his
fall than for his exaltation.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
A pension of 4000<i>l.</i> a year was offered to, and
rejected by, the Duke of Newcastle, who with all
his faults and weaknesses was never stained with
avarice and rapaciousness. The deepest tinge of
that dirty vice blotted the late Chancellor Northington,
who sold the Seals for the President’s place,
augmented by 5000<i>l.</i> a year, with the contingency
of 2000<i>l.</i> a year if he should quit the place of President,
and for the reversion of the Hanaper for
two lives.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> Grants so exorbitant, and so void of
any colour of merit in the fool on whom they were
showered, that if they cast a shade on the dawn
of Mr. Pitt’s new Administration, or recalled the
memory of his former waste, they reflected lustre
on the fallen Ministry, who had been beyond example
sparing of such shameless profusion. It was
not lessened by another contingent pension to Lord
Camden in case he should lose the Seals: yet as he
quitted the place of Chief Justice of the Common
Pleas for life, the boon was far more justifiable;
especially in an age when men were paid alike for
merit and demerit, for accepting or losing employments.</p>

<p>The services of the discarded Ministers were set
forth in a small, well written tract, called “A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
Short History of a late Short Administration.” It
did justice to their integrity, and it could not do
too much.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> The nation felt and allowed their
merit. Some counties and corporations complimented
them in addresses. The Parliament followed
the Court, and supported whoever was the
actual Minister; uniform in its way of voting,
though its votes of every year were inconsistent
with those of the preceding.</p>

<p>The glory with which the late Ministers retired
was half of it plucked from the laurels of the new
Earl of Chatham. That fatal title blasted all the
affection which his country had borne to him, and
which he had deserved so well. Had he been
as sordid as Lord Northington, he could not have
sunk lower in the public esteem. The people,
though he had done no act to occasion reproach,
thought he had sold them for a title, and, as words
fascinate or enrage them, their idol Mr. Pitt was
forgotten in their detestation of the Lord Chatham.
He was paralleled with Lord Bath, and
became the object at which were shot all the arrows
of calumny. He had borne his head above
the obloquy that attended his former pension—not
a mouth was opened now in defence of his
title; as innocent as his pension, since neither
betrayed him into any deed of servility to prerogative
and despotism. Both were injudicious; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
last irrecoverably so. The blow was more ruinous
to his country than to himself. While he held
the love of the people, nothing was so formidable
in Europe as his name. The talons of the lion
were drawn, when he was no longer awful in his
own forests.</p>

<p>The City of London had intended to celebrate
Mr. Pitt’s return to employment, and lamps for an
illumination had been placed round the Monument.
But no sooner did they hear of his new dignity,
than the festival was counter-ordered. The great
engine of this dissatisfaction was Lord Temple, who
was so shameless as to publish the history of their
breach, in which he betrayed every private passage
that Mr. Pitt had dropped in their negotiation and
quarrel, which could tend to inflame the public
or private persons against him.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> This malignant
man worked in the mines of successive factions for
near thirty years together. To relate them is
writing his life.</p>

<p>The next month was spent in changes and preferments,
which I shall recapitulate as briefly as
I can. Sir Charles Saunders, instigated by Lord
Albemarle, resigned his seat at the Admiralty, on
pretence of disliking Lord Egmont, the first Commissioner.
Lord Albemarle had been refused the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
Rangership of the Parks at Windsor. John Yorke<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a>
retired from the same board. Within a few days
Lord Egmont himself resigned, telling the King
he disapproved of Lord Chatham’s foreign system,
and should be afraid of embarrassing his Majesty’s
affairs. If they were to be debated in Council, he
could submit to the majority; but as he found one
man was to have more weight than six,<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> he begged
to be unemployed.</p>

<p>Lord Chatham was hurt at losing Saunders, one of
his favourite and most successful admirals in the
last war. Keppel,<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> too, intimated a like design of
retiring. To prevent the one and recover the
other, Lord Chatham, though sorely unwilling to
raise Sir Charles Saunders above Sir Edward Hawke
and Sir George Pocock, at last put the Admiralty
into the hands of Saunders. Lord Granby was
appointed Commander-in-chief, and Lord Ligonier
quieted with an earldom—at near ninety, and with
a reversion to his nephew of fifteen hundred pounds
a year of his pension. Even the promotion of Lord
Granby was a portion of another bargain, the price
of his father, the Duke of Rutland’s, quitting Master
of the Horse, which was given to Lord Hertford,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
that he might cede the government of Ireland to
Lord Bristol. Nor was the post of Master of the
Horse sufficient: the King promised Lord Hertford
should have the Chamberlain’s staff on the next
vacancy, which his Majesty added, he wished was
then—a confirmation of his dislike of the Duke of
Portland. Lord Hertford was too good a courtier
not to acquiesce, or to be satisfied. He prevailed to
have the borough of Orford, then dependant on the
Crown, where Lord Hertford had an estate, ceded
to him,—a boon unprecedented, and that made
much noise. The ill-conduct of the Court had reduced
the Crown to little more than to be able to
make changes; for it could scarce make an Administration,
though both Houses were ready to
support any that was made.</p>

<p>I ought to have mentioned, that, in consequence
of the Duke of Bedford’s offers, the Admiralty, on
Lord Egmont’s demission, was offered to Lord
Gower; Lord Chatham still deluding himself with
the thought that he could detach any separate man
from any connection. But if men were grown more
venal, they were grown, too, to understand their
own interests better than to loosen their strength
by separating themselves from powerful bodies; a
single and temporary emolument could not compensate
for the support of their friends. Lord Gower
answered that he could not stand <em>alone</em> in so responsible
a place, and was connected with none of
the present Ministry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
Lord Frederick Campbell was removed, and Mr.
Mackenzie restored to his ancient place.</p>

<p>However alert and peremptory Lord Chatham
was in offending or promoting, domestic power by
no means occupied his thoughts. The stocks had
fallen on his accession, from the apprehension entertained
that he would hurry into war. Had his
views succeeded, one cannot tell how soon it might
have been his measure. I know certainly that he
despatched emissaries to visit the frontier towns in
France. His immediate and avowed purpose was
to cement an union between England, Russia, and
Prussia.</p>

<p>Baron de la Perriere,<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> the Sardinian Envoy, had
given notice that the new Emperor<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> was much disinclined
to the French system, and even disposed to
break with that Court, beholding with an eye of discontent
their possession of his hereditary dominion,
Lorrain. It was expected that Count Kaunitz, his
mother’s Prime Minister, devoted to France, would
retire.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> I had sent notice of this favourable opening,
and had repeated it at my return from Paris.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
A short time before the change in the Ministry, an
event corroborated this intelligence. Count Seilern,
the Austrian Ambassador, had opened himself freely
to Mr. Conway, and said, if the latter would assure
him that we neither had leagued, nor would league
with Prussia, his court would enter into a defensive
league with us against France. Mr. Conway replied
we could not advance so far at once, but assured
him we were not, nor were likely to be, in league
with Prussia. Seilern was to report this answer,
and no reply was arrived when Mr. Pitt became
Minister. The King had been so indiscreet as to
tell Count Seilern in the drawing-room that Count
Malzahn, the new envoy from Berlin, had had his
audience, and was the first foreign Minister that
ever came to him without saying anything personally
civil.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt, full of a grand northern alliance, without
attending to the conjuncture, or above informing
himself of the situation, immediately names
Mr. Stanley<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> Ambassador to Russia instead of Sir
George Maccartney,<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> a personal favourite of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
Czarina, and who had just concluded a treaty of
commerce with her; and orders Stanley, in his way
to St. Petersburg, to learn if the King of Prussia
was disposed to enter into strict alliance with us.
The King had acquiesced in this new arrangement,
for he submitted even to treat with the King of
Prussia, whom he hated, rather than not accommodate
Lord Bute with a more favourable Administration.
Conway was thunderstruck. He saw we
should miss the opportunity of recovering the Court
of Vienna, and expected nothing from Prussia. To
add to the mortification, the nomination was made
in his own office, and he not acquainted with it till
it was done; nor had he been summoned to the
Council in which it was declared. So little confidence
to the confidential Minister looked ill, and
prognosticated how entirely the new Earl intended
to engross the sole direction. Conway wrote to Lord
Chatham to beg Mr. Stanley’s journey might not be
precipitated, but debated in Council: if the King’s
servants should approve it, he should acquiesce.
The Earl returned a very civil answer, and promised
they should consult on it. The event was, the
King of Prussia refused to receive Stanley’s visit,
and the Czarina did not like to admit an Ambassador.
After a long delay, Stanley’s embassy was laid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
aside<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a>—the union with Austria was lost. These
foreign disappointments, I believe, were the chief
ingredients in the strange conduct of Lord Chatham
that ensued. Peace was not his element; nor did
his talent lie in those details that restore a nation
by slow and wholesome progress. Of the finances
he was utterly ignorant. If struck with some great
idea, he neither knew how nor had patience to conduct
it. He expected implicit assent—and he expected
more, that other men should methodise and
superintend, and bear the fatigue of carrying his
measures into execution; and, what was worse,
encounter the odium and danger of them, while he
reposed and was to enjoy the honour, if successful.
The history of the ensuing winter will justify
every word here asserted. His conduct in the late<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
war had been the same. He drew the plans, but left
it to the Treasury to find the means; nor would
listen to their difficulties, nor hold any rein over
their ill-management.</p>

<p>While the attention of the great world was fixed
on the political revolution, the people laboured
under the dearness of corn and the apprehension of
famine. The two last seasons had been particularly
unfavourable; and though there was not absolute
want, the farmers kept back their corn, and would
not bring it to market, in order to enhance the price.
Great disturbances ensued in several counties: the
mob rose, seized provisions by force, or obliged the
venders to distribute them at the price fixed by the
people. In some places they burnt the barns of
those who concealed their corn, and committed
other violences. The worst tumults were at
Norwich and in the western counties, where the
peace could only be preserved by quartering regiments
in the most riotous districts. In this emergency,
the Council advised the King, as Parliament
was not sitting, to lay an embargo, by his own authority,
on the exportation of corn; an extension
of prerogative not used for a large number of years
but in a war, or on the imminent approach of one.
The Duke of Newcastle attended the Council, and,
to his honour, spoke heartily for a measure which
checked the evil. Who would believe that so
essential a remedy was converted into matter of
blame? That it was, reflected honour on the Administration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
Such crimes can only be found in a
dearth of accusation.</p>

<p>The Earl of Northumberland, offended at the
promotions of Lord Bristol and Lord Hertford, and
that even the Chamberlain’s staff was engaged to
the latter, broke out in complaints to Lord Chatham,
who, with a facility that seemed to imply a
secret understanding, consented that he should be
created a Duke. The King did not hesitate a moment;
the same day heard the grievance and the
indemnification. Lord Cardigan,<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> on an old promise,
obtained by Lord Bute, that he should be a Duke
whenever one was made, was raised to the same
rank; but Lord Chatham coupling it with a condition
to both, that the one should take no employment,
and the other resign the government of Windsor
Castle, Lord Cardigan refused the increase of
title, and would not part with his office, saying, he
thought titles were honours and rewards, not punishments.
Lord Northumberland acquiesced, and obtained
the precedence. The other being firm, carried
his point, kept his place, and got the dukedom. Had
Lord Chatham intended to bar solicitation for titles
by so unpleasant a restriction, he had acted wisely;
but, relinquishing it in Lord Cardigan’s case, it is probable
that his sole view was to disculpate himself
from the imputation of too open propensity to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
Favourite’s family. He offered an earldom to Lord
Monson in lieu of his place, which the Earl designed
for Mr. Popham; but Lord Monson would neither
accept the title nor resign the office. Lord Grantham<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a>
was removed from the Post-office in favour
of Mr. Prowse, who would not accept it, but the
former was partly indemnified by his son Robinson
being made a Lord of Trade.</p>

<p>In October Lord Chatham went to Bath, where I
happened to be. He came to me, and we had a
conversation of two hours. Nothing could be more
frank and unreserved than his behaviour. He asked
me earnestly if I did not think that France intended
to keep peace with us? I replied, I was sure in the
present distress of their circumstances they must
keep it: and that I was as sure from the terror I
had seen they felt at <em>his</em> name, that they would be
still more disposed to keep it now he was Minister.
He lamented that we could get no allies;
that he saw no day-light. The session he thought
he should carry through easily. To flatter me he
commended Mr. Conway highly, particularly for his
Whiggism—“and am not I,” said he, “Lord Camden,
and Lord Shelburne, Whigs?” Yet he wished
to take some of all parties. The Duke of Bedford,
indeed, had made himself nobody. Lord Gower
was considerable, and ought to be high. If the
Duke and Duchess desired it, Rigby might be taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
care of; but when Cabinet places were so scarce,
they wanted one for Lord Weymouth—a very pretty
man, Lord Weymouth!—but that could not be.
He had been offered the embassy to Spain, but
would not accept it; nor Postmaster, though it had
been held by Lord Grantham, who had been Secretary
of State. The King, he said, was very gracious
to him, and he believed in earnest—and then
dropped these remarkable words: “If I was in
possession of the citadel of Lisle, and was told
there was a mine under my feet, I would say, I do
not believe it.” His opinion of his Majesty’s sincerity
was therefore exactly the same as mine. I
took great pains to cultivate harmony between him
and Mr. Conway, because I feared it was little likely
to last.</p>

<p>The negotiation with the Duke of Bedford had
been renewed at Bath by Lord Northington and
Mr. Nugent. The Duke himself came thither and
they had an interview, in which Lord Chatham
desired artfully to open himself to his Grace, and
declared against Continental measures, subsidies, &amp;c.
(the very objects in which he had been disappointed,
but against which the Duke’s humour then lay.)
They could not agree on Lord Weymouth, which
made the Duke profess his unwillingness to abandon
his friends, though ready to abandon them if that
point had been accorded. However Lord Chatham
had made so much impression that, on the Duke’s return
to London, and being instantly beset by Grenville,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
the Duke said he was unpopular enough already,
and would not be torn to pieces for condemning the
embargo on corn. He would vote for the Address,
and insisted that Rigby should. The latter begged
to go out of town, and said to his friends that Lord
Chatham had duped the Duke of Bedford, and the
King Lord Gower, who had been particularly distinguished
at Court; that they were undone if they
voted with Administration before their bargain was
made.</p>

<p>Lord Temple and Lord Lyttelton went to the
Lord Mayor’s feast, but were totally neglected by
the citizens.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang40 b2">Debates on the Embargo laid on Corn.—Party Tactics.—Walpole
exerts himself to prevent Conway from resigning.—View of
Lord Chatham’s Conduct.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 11th of November the Parliament met.
Lord Suffolk opposed the Address of the Lords, and
the debate turned on the illegality of the late Act
of Council that had directed the embargo; the
Opposition censuring the Ministers for not having
called the Parliament to that end. To urge that
the necessity had been pressing, that the delay necessarily
attendant on issuing writs, on assembling the
members, on passing the Bill, would have wasted the
time, while the merchants who had contracted to
send corn abroad would have taken advantage of
such protraction and sent away their corn—and thus
the evil would not have been prevented by paying too
scrupulous regard to forms—these reasons did not
satisfy men who would have found greater fault if
the evil had not been prevented. The Duke of
Bedford was more moderate, but wished the Parliament
had been assembled. Lord Chatham, for
the first time of his appearing in that House, spoke
with coolness, dignity, and art, declaring that if any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
man was personal to him, or revived stories past, he
should take no notice of them. This seemed to
check Lord Temple’s heat, who, though severe in
arraigning, forbore invectives against Lord Chatham;
but proposed (as Mr. Grenville did in the
other House) to issue 200,000<i>l.</i> from the Treasury
for the relief of the poor—a vain attempt at popularity,
and deservedly ridiculed. Lord Northington,
with great boldness and defiance, said, he disclaimed
accepting any pardon for the part he had acted in
advising the embargo, and held law-books cheap
when weighed against such a crisis. For himself he
had acted on a larger scale. He concluded with
haranguing against disunion. Lord Temple reminded
him that two years before, he had declared
unanimity was destructive. Lord Mansfield, from
aversion to Lord Chatham and his Chancellor Camden,
was now the advocate of the Constitution. The
Act of Council he maintained was illegal, though he
said he would give no opinion as the case might
come before him in judgment, many suits being
commenced, he heard, against officers of the customs
for detaining corn from exportation on the authority
of the Council’s order. Prerogative! there was
no such thing: the King could do nothing but by
law; was only free from arrest for debt,—truths
that were scandalous in the mouth of a man whose
soul was sold to Despotism. Lord Camden answered
with firmness, and with sharp irony, on the new
Whiggism of the Chief Justice. Himself, he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
had always been Whig, and should continue so. If
it was not yet in our laws, it ought to be so,
that <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Salus populi suprema lex</i>. If this Act was
a stretch of prerogative, <em>it was but a tyranny of
forty days</em>. This sentence drew much censure—ridiculously
so. In every Government there is—must
be—a supreme power to exert itself when evils are
too mighty for the common channel of law to divert.
That power must have relieved the people, or they
would have relieved themselves, for men will not
starve, if you tell them there is no law that can help
them. The very phrase, too, <em>of forty days</em> implied
that liberty preceded and succeeded to that transient
tyranny. It is when unlimited that tyranny
is dreadful. The sentence, however, proved the
text on which the following libels were preached for
some months. Lord Mansfield was daunted, and
retracted, and the House rose without a division.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></p>

<p>In the other House Mr. Grenville held forth on
the illegality, and abused Mr. Conway, not for intention,
but for ignorance and blunders. Burke
spoke finely on the same side; but they could not
attempt a division, the Duke of Bedford’s people
having absented themselves. The Tories, however,
exclaimed against Lord Camden’s dispensing power;
a clamour that manifested their own principles.
The Whigs dread the prerogative being used <em>against</em>
the people; the Tories, it should seem, <em>for</em> the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
The schism raised in the Opposition by the Duke
of Bedford’s defection, and the general inclination
attached to the late Ministers to close with Lord
Chatham, had discouraged almost all thoughts of
opposition. Grenville and his dozen of followers in
vain attempted to rekindle it, and though Lord Rockingham
wished to figure as leader of a party even
out of place, and Burke, an adventurer, was to push
his way by distinguishing himself as a formidable
antagonist; yet the decency of that set of men was
such, even of Lord John Cavendish, that they did
not care to fly out. They retained much deference
for Mr. Conway; and too many of their friends
remained still in place, whom they might displease
and lose, and without whom their numbers would
be inconsiderable. They had acted, too, with such
recent animosity to George Grenville, that it was a
bitter resource to join his standard: nor were he
and Lord Rockingham compatible, the Treasury
being the object which neither would cede to the
other. So forlorn a prospect deadened all factious
spirit: Lord Temple went out of town. The Dukes
of Bedford and Richmond were to go on the 19th;
and though some scanty forces might rally after
Christmas, all who waited to judge from the size of
the majority whether duration might be expected
to the present Ministry, would probably by that
time have enlisted themselves in the troops of the
Court. This moment, fortunate beyond all calculation,
did Lord Chatham pitch upon to do the wildest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
of acts for the silliest of reasons. Without waiting
to let so prosperous a conjuncture ripen into a system,
he seemed to take a fortuitous concurrence of
circumstances for established power; and though the
predominant influence of the Court preserved him
from falling, he involved himself in such a labyrinth
of difficulties, that he found no other way of extricating
himself than by a conduct more preposterous
than the series of imprudence which had drawn him
into his perplexed situation. I must now relate
what he lost and for whom.</p>

<p>There was a nephew of the Duke of Newcastle
who, when the Whigs had broken with the Court
and sought to place Lord Chatham at their head,
had attached himself particularly to that chieftain.
Lord Lincoln,<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> the other nephew of the Duke, had
quarrelled, as I have said, indecently and ungratefully
with his uncle. Mr. Shelley,<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> the hero of
the present episode, had copied that ingratitude,
and for no worthier reason than because a peerage,
to which he had no pretensions, had not been added
to the boons his lavish uncle had already heaped on
him, had joined himself to his cousin. But Mr.
Pitt was his standard; and, furnishing himself with
scraps of that orator’s new-coined diction, he retailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
them on the most ordinary occurrences; so that as
Mr. Pitt was called <em>the Great Commoner</em>, the nickname
of <em>the Little Commoner</em> was bestowed on Shelley
in ridicule.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> This insignificant person did Lord
Chatham, to gratify Lord Lincoln, design for Treasurer
of the Household. Mr. Conway had remonstrated
against the dismission of Lord Edgcumbe,<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a>
who held that staff, insisting that an equivalent, at
least, should be given to Lord Edgcumbe, and with
his consent. This had passed about a month before
the meeting of the Parliament, and Lord Chatham
said no more at that time. But six days after the
opening of the session, Lord Shelburne, being with
Mr. Conway, said, “I wish you would tell me how
to write a civil letter to Lord Edgcumbe.” Conway
started, and asked on what occasion? “To notify
his dismission,” replied the other. Lord Chatham,
it seems, had offered a Lordship of the Bedchamber
to Lord Edgcumbe, a man of forty-five, very high in
the Navy, who had served with reputation in Lord
Chatham’s favourite war, and who, into a place only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
fit for a boy, must have entered below thirteen other
boys! Lord Edgcumbe very properly declining
such a post, Lord Chatham affected to resent it as
an affront to the King, and wrote a verbose notification
of the refusal to Mr. Conway, with frequent
repetitions of his Majesty’s name and intentions.
Conway, wounded at the treatment both of himself
and Lord Edgcumbe, wrote a firm answer, justifying
the latter.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> Lord Rockingham, getting wind of this
transaction, hurried to Mr. Conway, artfully reminding
him that the late Duke of Devonshire, at his
death, had recommended Lord Edgcumbe to the
Duke of Cumberland; and that Lord Edgcumbe
himself had lately, at Mr. Conway’s request, chosen
his nephew, Lord Beauchamp,<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> into Parliament.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a>
But Lord Chatham’s own conduct exasperated
Conway more than any incendiary could. He
wrote again to Conway, imputing all to the King’s
intentions and to the necessity of accommodation.
He could not have assigned a weaker
reason. Shelley would not even have a seat
in Parliament, for the Duke of Newcastle refused
to re-elect him. Lord Edgcumbe commanded four
boroughs, and it was within a year of the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
election. Instead of replying by letter, Conway
went and expostulated with Lord Chatham on the
ill-usage of his friend, and of the silence to himself,
desiring to retire; did not mean to oppose, but
thought that the Government could do without him
now Charles Townshend was in their service. Lord
Chatham talked of his desire of pleasing all parties
by taking some of all: some Bedfords—Burke, to
please Lord Rockingham—(but Burke had said he
would take nothing but on proviso of resigning, if
Lord Rockingham went into opposition—though, as
the Duke of Grafton told me, Burke would not
have been obdurate if his demands had not been too
extravagant)—Norton—Conway remonstrated—Lord
Chatham rejoined, “only in case of a vacancy,
perhaps Master of the Rolls, if the present should
die.”</p>

<p>While this matter was in suspense, Mr. Conway
moved the House of Commons for leave to bring in
a bill in favour of <em>all</em> who had acted under the
Order of Council for restraining exportation of
grain. Grenville said the motion was not adequate
to the case: the indemnity ought to extend to the
Privy Council, as had been customary in the reign of
Charles II. and at the Revolution. Yet he would
not then propose the amendment; would wait to
see the bill. If he should not find the extension
there, that great question would and should be discussed.
Burke, more moderate, said, it would be
sufficient if the preamble specified <em>all those who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
counselled or advised</em>. Beckford, to disculpate the
Chancellor, said, <em>in times of danger the Crown might
dispense with law</em>. Grenville started up, and demanded
that the clerk should take down those
words. Beckford said, he was glad to see that
gentleman so zealous for liberty <em>at present</em>, but that
he had interrupted him before he had finished his
sentence; that he was going to add, <em>by the advice
of his Council, for the salus populi</em>. Grenville demanded
that those words should be taken down
too. Several interposed, and desired that Beckford
might have leave to explain himself. Grenville
said, he aimed at the doctrine, not the person.
Beckford pleaded ignorance, and that he was not
one of the docti. Nugent replied, that the House
had often been witness to his ignorance. “But,
sir,” said he, “I exaggerate his ignorance to excuse
him.” Hussey, a very honest man, and who had
refused any preferment, though an intimate friend
of the Chancellor, stated an explanation of Beckford’s
meaning, which, indeed, was totally the reverse,
and a full definition of liberty against a dispensing
power, which the House accepted. I went
home with Mr. Conway, and though I entirely
approved what the Council had done, yet as precedents
of power cannot be too strongly guarded
against, I begged him, as Hussey had advised, to
obtain a firm declaration against a dispensing power
in the preamble to the bill. He was zealously
of that opinion, and said he would. I told him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
if Lord Chatham objected, <em>that</em> would be a much
more laudable and wise subject for breaking with
him, than on the private case of Lord Edgcumbe,
which the world would consider but as a squabble
about places and power. The Duke of Richmond
and Burke tried to persuade me that Mr.
Conway ought to break on Lord Edgcumbe, as
their friends would desert the party, if the party
did not resent the ill-treatment of individuals. I
replied, I would neither flatter his Grace, nor Lord
Rockingham; that, next to my country, I consulted
Mr. Conway’s honour, and desired they
should know it. That Mr. Conway could not
break for Lord Edgcumbe, when he had not quarrelled
with Lord Chatham on the Duke of Richmond’s
account. That if he quarrelled on some
constitutional point, he would bring double strength
to the party. To break on persons might be called
faction; and I thought too well of his friends to
believe they would leave him. Hitherto they had
not been very considerable; but their conduct in
Administration, and their quiet behaviour since out
of place, would give them new importance. That
they said, Lord Chatham wanted to ruin their
party: he might, but was recruiting them. That
he would reduce himself to be dependent on Lord
Bute, and would become of no consequence.—I did
not persuade them, nor they me.</p>

<p>Lord Edgcumbe conducted himself with singular
temper, being, in truth, desirous of an indemnification,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
which he told Mr. Conway he would still accept.
The latter tried to obtain an earldom for him.
Lord Chatham refused it with much verbiage, and
pleaded the honour of the King engaged, and that
himself had always determined to break all parties;
and a wise method<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> he took, no doubt, by declaring
that intention! It was not much wiser when he
condescended to intimate that he would offer something
to Lord Edgcumbe, but not for some days,
lest he should seem to be forced. Lord John
Cavendish said to me, he supposed Lord Chatham
would not yield. I replied, Certainly not; but if he
would, we should have a great triumph. This was
to reconcile them to it in case the offer came. He
told me the Duke of Portland and Lord Besborough
would resign, unless Mr. Conway should desire
them not. I understood this; it was an artifice to
lay him under stronger obligations to them. Lord
Besborough, extremely unwilling to resign, offered
to give up the Post Office to Lord Edgcumbe, and,
though a place he should dislike, (for he was still
an older man,) to take the Bedchamber himself.
Mr. Conway, charmed, as thinking this would
accommodate everything, immediately sent word of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
it to the Duke of Grafton; but in a little hour received
from Lord Chatham a haughty and despotic
answer, <em>that he would not suffer connections to force
the King</em>. Mr. Conway, losing all patience, wrote
to the Duke of Grafton, <em>that such language had never
been held west of Constantinople</em>. Still, however, to
prevent the rupture, I persuaded him to soften the
expression to, <em>in this country</em>; and insinuated to him,
that Lord Besborough’s offer was a snare laid by
Lord John, and conceived from my having told him
that Lord Chatham would certainly not bend.</p>

<p>On the 22nd the Duke of Grafton told Mr. Conway
that Lord Chatham had no objection to his
proposing anything to the King in favour of Lord
Edgcumbe, but would not himself: and the Duke
added, “If the King would still grant it.” This
made me fear another repulse. Mr. Conway, however,
who scorned to bend to Lord Chatham’s
haughtiness, desired his brother to ask an audience
of the King, in order to make the proposals.
Yet I obtained a delay till I should try to prevail
on Lord Edgcumbe to accept the Bedchamber.
In the mean time I met Lord Rockingham,
who, taking me aside, laughed at the idea
of Lord Besborough’s proposal; said it was a joke,
and that Lord Chatham would only have laughed
at them for it. I said, very seriously, “What,
my Lord, have you sent Mr. Conway on a fool’s
errand, and now disavow him?” He replied, the
party knew nothing of it. Lord Besborough had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
done it from himself to prevent a rupture. I
said Mr. Conway had received the proposal from
the Duke of Portland. He said, he was sure not:
yet so it proved. He pressed me earnestly to encourage
Mr. Conway to resign. I said I could not
take upon me to advise him to give up all he had.
He laughed and said, it could not be for long;
everything came round in this country. I replied,
“Your Lordship, with twenty thousand pounds a
year, talks very much at your ease; but Mr. Conway
would have nothing in the world, and would
not go into opposition to recover his fortune. He
has told both Lord Chatham and the Duke of
Grafton that he will not oppose.” This conversation
was so ill taken, which was indifferent to me,
that it broke off all correspondence between me and
Lord Rockingham. I went to Mr. Conway and
represented to him that they were trying to dupe
him: that they now disavowed him, as they had
done on Lord Chatham’s visit to the Marquis; and
I added, that though Lord Rockingham affected to
resent so warmly for him the treatment of Lord
Chatham, his Lordship had treated him in the same
manner the last spring on the establishment for the
Princes. I wished to stop Mr. Conway from resigning
till Lord Chatham should have gained the
Bedfords from George Grenville; I wished to give
Grenville time to involve himself in further declarations
for liberty; I wished Mr. Conway to have
a regiment again, which I had been the cause of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
his losing; and I was not unwilling to convince
Lord Rockingham and Lord John Cavendish that
Mr. Conway was not to receive orders from them.
Of these four points, of which the second in
truth would have availed little<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> but to disgrace
Grenville if he returned to power, I accomplished
all but one; and it will be soon seen that that, like
many other prudential views, was defeated solely
by the mismanagement of Lord Chatham. Wearisome
contests it cost me for six months to prevent
Mr. Conway’s resignation; and though I succeeded,
and afterwards shut the door both on Grenville and
Lord Rockingham, the person<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> who profited of my
fatigues, and of the credit I had with Mr. Conway,
proved so unworthy; and so sick did I grow both of
that person and of the fatigues I underwent, that I
totally withdrew myself from the scene of politics,
and tasted far more satisfaction in my retreat than
I had done in the warmest moments of success and
triumph. The joys of a private station present
themselves—are bought by no anxiety. I never
found pleasures answer that were purchased by
trouble. It is like many moral aphorisms, a theme
for poets, untrue in practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
All proposals of accommodations proving fruitless,<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a>
Lord Edgcumbe was dismissed, and his staff
placed in Shelley’s hands. The wound rankled so
deeply in Mr. Conway’s bosom, that he dropped
all intercourse with Lord Chatham; and though
he continued to conduct the King’s business in the
House of Commons, he would neither receive nor
pay any deference to the Minister’s orders, acting
for or against, as he approved or disliked his measures;—a
scorn that became his character, and
which he supported with very different dignity from
that of Lord Chatham, whose tone being fictitious
and assumed, could not bear him out in the implicit
obedience he expected. Like oracles and groves,
whose sanctity depended on the fears of the devout,
and whose mysterious and holy gloom vanished
as soon as men dared to think and walk through
them, Lord Chatham’s authority ceased with his
popularity; and his godhead, when he had affronted
his priests.</p>

<p>In all his actions was discernible an imitation
of his model, Ximenes; a model ill-suited to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
free government, and worse to a man whose situation
and necessities were totally different. Was
the poor monk thwarted or disgraced, the asylum
of his convent was open; and a cardinal, who
was clothed in a hair-cloth at Court, missed no
fine linen, no luxury, in his cloister. Lord Chatham
was as abstemious in his diet; but mixed Persian
grandeur with herbs and roots. His equipages and
train were too expensive for his highest zenith of
wealth, and he maintained them when out of place
and overwhelmed with debts: a wife and children
were strange impediments to a Ximenes. Grandeur,
show, and a pension could not wrestle with
an opulent and independent nobility, nor could he
buy them, though he had sold himself. His services
to his country were far above those of Ximenes,
who trampled on Castilian pride but to
sacrifice it to the monarch of Castile. Lord Chatham
had recalled the spirit of a brave nation, had
given it victory and glory, and victory secured
its liberty. As Ximenes had no such objects, the
inflexibility of Ximenes was below the imitation
of Camillus. It was mean ambition to stoop from
humbling the crowned heads of France and Spain,
to contend with proud individuals and the arrogance
of factions—at least, would a real great
man have doated on a coronet, who prided himself
in lowering the peerage? Lord Chatham had been
the arbiter of Europe; he affected to be the master
of the English nobility: he failed, and remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
with a train of domestics whom he could not pay.
More like Nicholas Rienzi than Ximenes, the lord
of Rome became ridiculous by apeing the tawdry
pageant of a triumph. Yet, as what is here said
is the voice of truth, not the hiss of satire, British
posterity will ever remember that, as Lord Chatham’s
first Administration obtained and secured the
most real and substantial benefits to his country,
the puerilities of his second could not efface their
lustre. The man was lessened, not his merits.
Even the shameful peace of Paris, concluded in
defiance of him, could not rob the nation of all
he had acquired; nor could George the Third
resign so much as Pitt had gained for George the
Second. Half the empire of Indostan, conquered
under his Administration by the spirit he had infused,
still pours its treasures into the Thames.
Canada was subdued by his councils, and Spain
and France—that yet dread his name, attest the
reality of his services. The memory of his eloquence,
which effected all these wonders, will
remain when the neglect of his cotemporaries,
and my criticisms, will be forgotten. Yet it was
the duty of an annalist, and of a painter of nature,
to exhibit the varying features of his portrait. The
lights and shades of a great character are a moral
lesson. Philosophy loves to study the man more
than the hero or the statesman; and whether his
qualities were real or fictitious, his actions were
so illustrious, that few names in the registers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
Time will excite more curiosity than that of William
Pitt.</p>

<p>When Mr. Conway presented the Bill of Indemnity
to the House, he ushered it in with strong
declarations against the Chancellor’s doctrine of
necessity justifying a dispensing power. He was
much applauded by Grenville for extending the
Indemnity to the Council, the latter inveighing
against Lord Camden, and ascribing his tenets to
folly, ignorance, weakness, and wickedness, such
as cost Charles I. his life, and James II. his
crown. Conway, who felt that himself had gone
too far, took that opportunity of apologizing for
the Chancellor, who, he said, he believed was no
friend to a dispensing power in an odious light:
the dispensing power claimed by Charles and James
had not been founded on necessity. The Bill was
ordered to be printed. After the debate I asked
Lord John Cavendish if it was not more desirable
to have the dispensing power condemned by a
Minister than by a man in opposition?</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang b2">Lord Chatham proposes to examine the East India Company’s
Affairs.—His unaccountable conduct.—More signs of weakness
in the Cabinet.—Negotiation with the Duke of Bedford.—Bill
of Indemnity.—Debates on the East India Question.—Attack
on Lord Chatham in the House of Lords by the Duke of Richmond.</p></blockquote>

<p>These petty politics were soon absorbed in the
consideration of a more momentous and more arduous
affair. Restrained as Lord Chatham’s genius
was by the tranquillity of Europe, and impeded as
his plan had been by his own want of conduct,
his soul was still expanding itself towards greater
objects. With indignation, he beheld three Indian
provinces, an empire themselves, in the hands of
a company of merchants, who, authorized by their
charter to traffic on the coast, had usurped so
mighty a portion of his dominions from the Prince
who permitted their commerce with his subjects.
By what horrid treachery, fraud, violence, and
blood the Company’s servants had stridden to such
aggrandizement, was not a question a Minister
was likely to ask. It is the cool humane man,
who had no power to punish and redress such
crimes, who alone reasons <em>on the manner how</em>, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
<em>the right</em> by which such acquisitions are obtained.
The stupendous fortunes created by individuals
struck more forcibly on the political eye of Lord
Chatham. Above any view of sharing the plunder
himself, he saw a prey that tempted him to make
it more his country’s. By threats to intimidate
the Company, and incline them to offer largely
towards the necessities of Government, was the
least part of his idea. Such a tribute would stand
in the place of new taxes, or relieve the debts
on the Civil List: could he induce the Parliament
to think the Company had exceeded the powers
of their charter, the whole property of their territorial
acquisitions might be deemed forfeited to
the Crown; this would be a bribe with which
few Ministers could purchase the smiles of their
master. Nor could common sense find a flaw in
the reasoning. Could it be intended, what country
ever meant by granting a charter for trading and
building forts to secure their magazines, say, even
by allowing them to defend themselves against
open hostilities; could it be understood, I ask,
that such a charter gave up the dominion of whole
provinces to a set of private merchants—of three
provinces more ample than the extent of the
country which bestowed the charter? The event
could not be foreseen—it could not be foretold
by prophecy’s wildest imagination; but if common
sense could not answer the question, self-interest
could. What! invade property!—those two words,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
<em>Invasion of property</em>, branched into every subtlety
that law could furnish. And as it has been well
said,<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> <em>that in England all abuses are freeholds</em>, most
of those that had property in the East India Company,
most of those who had any other property,
and all who enjoyed any property by abuses, took
the alarm; and they who desired to obstruct any
measures of Government, were sedulous not to let
the panic cool.</p>

<p>But if the plan was great and bold, the execution
was mean and unworthy of the conception. The
man who traced the design, shrank from it himself;
and having tossed it into the world, left it to be
carried through by other hands. He grew mysterious;
he would not declare what he wished—Parliament
must decide—but his anger awaited those
who should even decline guessing at his purpose. I
feel while I write that I shall scarce be credited:
yet both words and matter cannot be more strictly
true. Lord Chatham would not utter his will or
wish; yet neither obstacles nor remonstrance could
extort a syllable of relaxation from him; but I must
take the matter a little higher, and relate it more
historically.</p>

<p>So early as the 28th of August the Cabinet
Council had sent for the Governors of the East
India Company, and advised them to be prepared,
for Parliament would certainly inquire into the
state of their acquisitions in Bengal. The Governors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
asked if the Administration intended to carry
the affair thither? They were told that the Ministers
had not determined to proceed so far, but did
not mean to preclude themselves from doing so.
Thus the affair had been left. The Company were
to be alarmed; the nation to be tempted to look
into the matter. The Company, no doubt, were
alarmed accordingly; but the nation with folded
arms awaited the event, not apt of late to forerun
Ministers in what they declare they meditate themselves.</p>

<p>In this uncommunicated state the dictator had
left the business, and the Parliament had met without
his assigning their departments in the action to
any of the Ministers—not to the Duke of Grafton
himself, the head of the Treasury, and who, though
as a peer not qualified to conduct the plan through
the House of Commons, yet was the person who
must superintend and transact an affair which, whether
in a greater or less proportion, was ultimately
to centre in the revenue, had he disclosed how far
he meant or wished to go. In the mean time had
intervened the episode of Lord Edgcumbe; and
Conway, the acting Minister in the House of Commons,
had been disgusted. Never officious to thrust
himself into business, and now indisposed to the
great projector, he neither was ambitious to receive
orders, nor forward to apply for them at the fountain-head;
yet being well disposed to the plan, and,
at least, too much versed in business, not to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
the propriety of digesting so very daring a scheme
before it was thrown into the House of Commons,
where, had there been no men of ill intention, still
a rude design must create confusion and impediment,
he had pressed earnestly to have it well considered
in Council, before it was introduced into Parliament.
His prayers and remonstrances were vain;
and though Lord Chatham depended on him for the
conduct of the Ministerial part, he would not deign
to impart a ray of instruction. There was another
man still more necessary perhaps to the progress
of a scheme of a monied nature; and that was the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Charles Townshend.
But him Lord Chatham neither trusted nor considered
but as the mere slave of his orders. Be it so:
yet could it be imagined that instead of employing
either Secretary of State or Chancellor of the
Exchequer, the Minister should have consigned his
darling scheme to a private man—and that man the
most absurd, and of as little weight as any member
in the House of Commons? So the fact was, and
so must I recount it. But ere the project was
opened, it was known that the versatile genius of
the Chancellor of the Exchequer was playing tricks
and endeavouring to obstruct the measure yet in
embryo. Conway, zealous for extracting some national
advantage from the prosperous state of the
Company’s affairs, laboured to surmount Townshend’s
objections, and assembled a council at his
own house to debate the point with him. Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
Chatham flamed at the notice of Townshend’s adverse
conduct, and vowed himself would resign, or
Townshend should be turned out; and he resented
Conway’s interfering to serve him without his direction.
Yet, ere the business came to any conclusion,
Townshend exhibited many doubts; though for
once his inconsistencies and treachery were not
solely dictated by unsteadiness. It became known
that his frequent fluctuations in the course of the
affair were so many wiles to raise or lower the stock
in which he was dealing, and which the Chancellor
of the Exchequer could supremely agitate and depress
as he pleased.</p>

<p>On the 25th the plan was first intimated to the
House by Lord Chatham’s confident, Alderman
Beckford, who moved to take into consideration
the state of the East India Company’s affairs. Men
were amazed to see a machine of such magnitude
entrusted to so wild a charioteer. Wedderburne
and Charles Yorke opposed the motion. The Whigs
deserted Mr. Conway who supported it, by the
mouth of their spokesman, Lord John Cavendish,
though he paid profuse compliments to the latter.
Burke and Grenville appeared as opponents, too,
and the violation of property was sounded high.
Yet the motion was carried by 129 to 76, Charles
Townshend speaking for it, and the Duke of Bedford’s
friends staying away.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> The wind, however, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
this transaction, and the dissensions that had sprung
up from the dismission of Lord Edgcumbe, brought
Lord Temple back to town. Grenville painted the
East Indian business to Rigby as a mine in which
Lord Chatham must blow himself up; and that idea
was impressed more deeply by Lord Northington,
who said to Lord Gower, “There are four parties,
Bute’s, Bedford’s, Rockingham’s, and Chatham’s, and
we (the last) are the weakest of the four.”</p>

<p>On the 27th of November the Duke of Portland,
Lord Scarborough, Lord Besborough, and
Lord Monson resigned their employments. The
King immediately appointed Lord Hertford Lord
Chamberlain; but told him that, knowing his brother’s
delicacy on the preferment of his relations,
he had hidden the stick and key, while Mr. Conway,
who had just been with him, was in the closet.</p>

<p>This defection of the Rockingham party, of whom
scarce a dozen<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> remained in connection with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
Court, reduced Lord Chatham, who had defeated
his own purpose of dividing them, to look out for
new strength. There remained Lord Bute’s and
the Duke of Bedford’s factions. He approached
towards both; but so coldly, and with such limited
steps, that he acquired neither, and fixed the last
in more open opposition. By preferring a few of
the Favourite’s creatures, he drew odium on himself,
without doing enough to engage their real
attachment, the very rock on which his predecessors
had split, though their more reluctant offers
having arrived too late, they had escaped the imputation
of stooping to servile conditions. Lord
Chatham’s conduct towards the Bedfords was as
void of dexterity as his treatment of the Rockingham
party.</p>

<p>The very evening of the resignations he sent for
Lord Gower, and offered to make him Master of the
Horse, and to connect with the Duke of Bedford;
but telling him that if they declined his offers, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
could stand without them. With regard to Mr.
Rigby, he had talked so hostilely on the East
Indian affair, that he must explain his conduct
before anything could be done for him. Lord
Gower, impatient to return to Court, jealous of
Rigby’s influence over his sister, the Duchess, and
satisfied with such fair terms for himself, gladly
accepted the commission, and set out next morning
for Woburn to open it to the Duke of Bedford and
obtain his acquiescence.</p>

<p>Rigby, in the mean time, whether apprehending
that the wildness of Lord Chatham would overturn
him, or overpersuaded by Grenville, or rather
hoping no great emolument for himself, from Lord
Chatham’s neglect of him and application through
another, had preceded Lord Gower, and got to
Woburn overnight. He found the Duchess as
eager as her brother to return to Court, and the
Duke prepared by her not to listen to his objections.
The next day he had the mortification of
seeing Lord Gower arrive, and of hearing the suspension
imposed on himself till he should correct
his behaviour. Deaf to his arguments and interest,
the whole family accepted with thankfulness Lord
Chatham’s overtures, and Lord Gower was remanded
to town to notify their consent and the
Duke’s intention to follow and ratify the treaty.
Rigby remained a day behind, but could not recall
the Duke from the alacrity with which he hurried
to London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
But even before Lord Gower could arrive there,
Lord Chatham, who rarely deigned to impart his
measures to the rest of the Ministers, had now, with
still less prudence, notified to the Council his offers
to the Bedfords, in the style of one sure of their
being accepted. At the same time, speaking of the
resigners, he said, they were only the remnant of the
late Duke of Cumberland’s party. Conway fired
at the expression, and said he would hear no such
language, nor ever bear disrespectful mention of
the Duke of Cumberland’s name. Lord Chatham
retracted; if he had not, Mr. Conway protested to
me he would have left the Council and returned to
it no more.</p>

<p>Lord Gower had gone on the Friday, and returned
the next day with the Duke of Bedford’s
assent; and the Duke himself arrived on the Monday.
Yet, in that little interval, considerable
events had happened, and a far more considerable
imprudence of Lord Chatham. Admiral Saunders,
a most gallant, but weak man, governed by Admiral
Keppel and Lord Albemarle, had been persuaded
by them to throw up his post of First Lord of the
Admiralty, and join his old friends the Rockinghams.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a>
The blow was heavy on Lord Chatham,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
but facilitated his treaty with the Bedfords, as he
had thereby a Cabinet-Councillor’s place to offer
them. Instead of profiting of the opportunity, and
as if the Bedford faction were men easily satisfied,
and with trifles, he would not wait for the Duke,
but filled up the Admiralty with Sir Edward
Hawke, Sir Piercy Brett, and Jenkinson—the two
last in the room of Sir William Meredith and
Keppel, resigners; at the same time causing
Keppel to be struck out of the King’s Bedchamber.
Sir Edward Hawke had as much merit in
his profession and to his country as man could
have, but no moment of rewarding him could have
been more imprudently taken. Though the place
might have been destined for him, still the faith
of negotiation ought to have been observed till
Lord Chatham could have satisfied the Bedfords
and agreed with them on that disposition. And
where was the policy of warning them that he
meant to admit them into no office of confidence?</p>

<p>Rigby, too alert and too artful to let slip an incident
so favourable to his inclination, and who saw
from this step how little would be allotted to his
party, and aware, from the treatment of the Rockinghams,
that Lord Chatham meant little more than
to break the Bedford connection too, inflamed the
Duke of Bedford and all their friends with the indignity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
offered to them in the very hour of treaty.
The Duchess had been left at Woburn, trusting to
the impression she had made on her husband, whom
she was now as solicitous to recover from Rigby’s
influence, as in their younger intimacy she had been
to place him there. Her security betrayed her;
the Duke caught fire; and he who had thought the
most bounded terms satisfactory, was now persuaded
to carry to Lord Chatham a list of demands that
comprehended half the employments in the Court-calendar,
besides peerages for some of his friends.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a>
Such enormous terms Rigby knew would not be
granted; but the demand would palliate to their
friends the total sacrifice that would have been
made of them if he and one or two more had found
their account in the first proposals. Lord Chatham
received his Grace’s extravagant list, but told him
he did not believe the King would comply with his
demands. The next day he waited on the Duke and
informed him that his Majesty was willing to make
his son, Lord Tavistock, a peer: to appoint Lord
Gower Master of the Horse, and Mr. Rigby Cofferer;
but as for entering on other particulars of places and
peerages, his Majesty would not hear of them. The
Duke begged his Majesty might be thanked for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
goodness to his son, but said his friends could not
think of accepting on such terms.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> Thus an end
was put at once to the negotiation. In the list had
been asked posts of Cabinet Councillor for Lord
Gower, Lord Sandwich, Lord Weymouth, and the
Duke of Marlborough, or the first vacant garter for
the latter (the Duke’s son-in-law) after the King’s
brother, Henry, the new Duke of Cumberland, and
peerages for Lord Lorne and Mr. Brand,<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> though
the Duke of Bedford, at the commencement of the
treaty, had positively refused the former to solicit
for him.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></p>

<p>The treaty evaporated, the vacant employments
were filled with some of Lord Bute’s creatures, and
any stragglers without connexion that could be
picked up. Thus the Duke of Ancaster was made
Master of the Horse to the King, and was succeeded
in the same rank to the Queen by Earl Delawar,
already her servant. Lord Hilsborough and Lord
Despenser were appointed joint Postmasters; Nugent,<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a>
First Lord of Trade; and Stanley, Cofferer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
Conway’s disgusts were doubled by seeing himself
reduced to act with scarce any but Lord Bute’s
friends; and had Lord Chatham continued the effective
Minister, would, I am persuaded, have resigned
like the rest, for however gentle when he met with
respect, he was minutely jealous of the smallest
neglect, and incompatible with the haughty temper
of Lord Chatham. Charles Townshend, restless in
any situation, fond of mischief, and not without
envy of the lead allotted to Conway, was incessant
in inciting him to retire, by painting to him the
pride and folly of Lord Chatham, the improbability
of his maintaining such shattered power, and alarming
him with threats of resigning and leaving him
alone in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>To this mad situation had Lord Chatham reduced
himself; first, by quitting the House of Commons
and thereby parting with his popularity; secondly,
by disgusting the Whigs, his best and firmest support;
thirdly, by never communicating a syllable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
Mr. Conway, nor trusting him, though his only
friend in the House of Commons; fourthly, by turning
out Lord Edgcumbe, when all opposition was
damped and in a manner annihilated; and, lastly,
by not gaining the Bedfords from Grenville, when it
was in his power. He had nothing left to try, but
whether by the mere influence of the Crown, without
leaders, and almost without speakers in the
House of Commons, he could govern against all the
other parties,<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> who, though hating each other, would
all probably unite against him.</p>

<p>Conway, however out of temper, supported honourably
the duty of his station; and, in the course
of the Bill of Indemnity, distinguished both his zeal
and capacity. In the Committee, Grenville and
Rigby moved to have stated the losses of those
who had suffered by acting under the order of
Council. Burke and Dowdeswell spoke on the
same side; but Conway, by an artful speech, gained
over Dowdeswell, and Grenville did not dare to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
divide the House. He next tried to avoid the
preamble of the bill, and moved to adjourn.
Charles Townshend and he had a sharp altercation,
in which Townshend both ridiculed and flattered
him. Lord Granby declared warmly for Lord
Chatham; Conway spoke handsomely of him too,
though intending to add censure to praise, but was
interrupted by Rigby; and thus the praise remained
alone. The Cavendishes having been consulted
on the bill, would therefore not divide
against it, and went away. Rigby, impatient to
mark his resentment to Lord Chatham, and fondly
thinking their numbers would appear formidable,
even without the Cavendishes, advised to push a
division; and Wedderburne actually divided the
House when the Ministerial party amounted to
166, and the Opposition but to 48: a signal victory
in Lord Chatham’s circumstances! But Lord
Bute’s friends had signalized themselves in his
support. Elliot and Dyson spoke for him; and
Sir Fletcher Norton retired rather than vote against
him. It was even suspected that Wedderburne,
who, though of the same corps, commonly opposed
like Norton, to force himself into place, had
treacherously drawn on the division to expose
the weakness of an Opposition without harmony;
nor was there anything in Wedderburne’s character
to counteract the suspicion. Some there were
who believed that Lord Bute, apprehending the
junction of Lord Chatham and the Bedfords, had,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
during the treaty, made overtures to the former,
which had encouraged him to act so imprudently
and cavalierly in that negotiation. But, if duped
then, it never appeared afterwards that Lord
Chatham had given himself up to a real connection
with the Favourite.</p>

<p>If the Opposition were startled at their defeat,
and Rigby did repent his precipitancy, Mr. Conway
was not a little startled too. He saw Lord Chatham
would stand, whether he quitted or not. He had
declared against going into opposition; nor was it his
inclination. Should he quit in those circumstances,
he would become a cypher, and remain divested of
his profession. I saw his difficulties and felt them.
I told him that he had lately asked me whether I
would advise him to stay and be turned out with disgrace
with a falling Administration? I reminded him
that in those circumstances I had acquiesced, and had
allowed that he could not stay, nor support alone a
system that hung on Lord Bute. But the case was
altered now: it was plain the Opposition was too
weak to demolish Lord Chatham; and therefore,
as Lord Chatham was likely to continue in power,
I wished him to stay in place likewise. At the
same time I sent Lord Hertford to beg his Majesty
would press Mr. Conway not to quit. The King
said he had just written to Mr. Conway, and told
him his Government depended on <em>his</em> conducting
the business of the House of Commons. Lord
Hertford replied, he believed his brother was more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
inclined to stay than he had been. The King said,
eagerly, “How have you brought it about? I am
sure you and Mr. Walpole have done it.”</p>

<p>On the 9th, Beckford proceeded on the East
Indian plan, and moved for inspection of their
charters, treaties, revenue in Bengal, and an account
of what they had expended. He expatiated
justly on the devastation the Company’s servants
had committed, and urged that new adventurers,
not old proprietors of India Stock, were the men
who profited of this accession of wealth, and who
were practising all arts to convert into a selfish job
a source of riches that ought to be conducted to
national advantage. The Opposition treated the
plan as chimerical. Could Bengal, they asked, be
stated as a permanent possession? Cust, the Speaker’s
brother, concerned in the Company, admitted
that the Government was entitled to expect a
return from the Company, as their settlements had
been preserved by the navy, and depended on the
protection of the public. But though his confession
was candid, he was faithful too to the interests
of the Company, and started many difficulties.
No proposal, he said, could be made but to the
General Court of Proprietors. Many proprietors
would object, not intending to continue so. The
revenue was not so large as pretended. Lord Clive
computed it at one million seven hundred thousand
pounds: Sumner’s account settled it at one million
four hundred thousand; himself did not believe it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
exceeded twelve hundred thousand. The Company,
on their forts, armaments, &amp;c., had expended five
millions. Senegal and Goree, while in private hands,
were maintained for eight thousand pounds a year;
since the public had taken them under their own
direction, they had cost twenty-six thousand pounds
a year. Burke, in one of his finest speeches, declaimed
against the measure: it was the first instance
of dragging to the bar men with whom the
public meant to treat. They were accused, that
their property might be confiscated. A dangerous
attempt was making for little advantage. On
Lord Chatham his figures were severe, painting him
as a great Invisible Power, that left no Minister
in the House of Commons. The greatest Integrity
(Conway) had no power there. The rest approached
him veiling their faces with their wings.
Let us supplicate this divinity, said he, that he
would spare public credit. Augustus Hervey called
him to order. “I have often suffered,” added
Burke, “under persecution of order, but did not
expect its lash while at my prayers. I venerate
the great man, and speak of him accordingly.”<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a>
Many other speeches were made for and against
the motion, particularly by the lawyers; on which
Colonel Barré said, the artillery of the law he saw
was brought down on both sides; but, like artillery,
had not done much hurt. He was for trying this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
question by common sense. He then read the
opinions which Lord Camden and Charles Yorke
had given when the charter was granted, in which,
though favourable to the Company, they had said,
“for what might follow, policy must take time to
consider.” This implied that they did not understand
conquests as granted away by the charter;
yet Yorke had now defended the Company as
entitled from their charter to their present acquisitions.
Bolton, one of the Company, who, though
he voted for the motion, said much against it,
owned that the Company could not govern their
servants, nor could Clive go on without the interposition
of Government. Charles Townshend,
having been chidden by the Duke of Grafton for
his variations, took advantage of what Bolton had
said, and spoke finely for the motion. Grenville,
in answer to Barré, said he did not desire to be
decided by military common sense; and dwelt with
much emphasis on the sacredness of charters, property,
and public credit; affirming that the affairs of
no company had ever been decided in that House.
Conway showed in a masterly manner that Grenville’s
assertions were all false; that the affairs of the
Hudson’s Bay and other companies had been inquired
into by Parliament. In answer to Burke,
he said, he disclaimed slavery; <em>was only a passenger</em>
in Administration, but always remonstrated against
whatever was contrary to his opinion. Dempster,
as a proprietor, declared against the motion; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
though Grenville had announced the dissatisfaction
the measure would occasion, it created less heat than
he expected: nor did either directors or proprietors
petition against it, those who had been most
alarmed soon discovering that whatever should be
gained from the Company, would stand in lieu of
burthens that otherwise might be laid on themselves.
The Opposition dividing for adjournment
were beaten by 140 to 56; not above twenty of
Lord Rockingham’s party having yet joined Grenville.</p>

<p>The next day the Bill of Indemnity, which had
passed the Commons, was read in the House of
Lords. The Duke of Richmond called on the
Chancellor and President to explain their doctrine
of necessity justifying a dispensing power. Lord
Northington adhered to his opinion, and said, on
a jury he should have found for the affirmative.
Lord Camden said, he should not, but would have
given trifling or no damages to the sufferers. Lord
Mansfield went through a laborious history of the
Constitution, and vindicated himself from the reproach
of being a prerogative lawyer: had always
been a friend to the Constitution; on that ground
had supported former Administrations, did support
this, and would support succeeding Administrations.
Lord Camden told him, he was glad he was returned
to that doctrine. Lord Chatham said, that
when the people should condemn him, he should
tremble; but would set his face against the proudest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
connection in this country. The Duke of Richmond
took this up with great heat and severity, and said,
he hoped the nobility would not be brow-beaten by
an insolent Minister. The House calling him to
order, he said with great quickness, he was sensible
truth was not to be spoken at all times, and in all
places. Lord Chatham challenged the Duke to give
an instance in which he had treated any man with
insolence; if the instance was not produced, the
charge of insolence would lie on his Grace.
The Duke said, he could not name the instance
without betraying private conversation; and he
congratulated Lord Chatham on his new connection,
the Duke looking, as he spoke, at Lord Bute.
The Duke of Bedford did not speak, though he had
been brought to town on purpose: but the Duchess,
displeased with Rigby for breaking off the negotiation,
had accompanied her husband, and even tried
to renew the treaty, but was forced to desist, the
places being filled up. On the Bill of Indemnity
there was no division; and on the 15th the Parliament
was adjourned for the holidays.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his success, Lord Chatham was
stunned by so rough an attack from the Duke of
Richmond, a young man not to be intimidated by
supercilious nods, or humbled by invective, which
his Grace had shown himself more prone to give
than receive. The silence of the place, and the
decency of debate there, were not suited to that
inflammatory eloquence by which Lord Chatham had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
been accustomed to raise huzzas from a more numerous
auditory. Argument, at least decorum,
would be expected, not philippics. Whether these
reflections contributed or not to augment the distaste
which the ill-success of his foreign, and the
errors he had committed in domestic politics, had
impressed on his mind, certain it is that the Duke
of Richmond had the honour of having the world
believe that by one blow he had revenged himself
and his party, and driven his proud enemy from
the public stage; for from that day Lord Chatham,
during the whole remainder of his Administration,
appeared no more in the House of Lords, really
becoming that invisible and inaccessible divinity
which Burke has described, and in three months as
inactive a divinity as the gods of Epicurus.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> His
last act was bestowing an English barony on Lord
Lorne, who, having failed through the Duke of
Bedford, applied himself directly to the Minister.
Lord Lorne had acquainted Mr. Conway with his
wish, who was greatly distressed, as a favour from
Lord Chatham (whom Mr. Conway intended to quit)
might again destroy the harmony which was now
re-established between him and his wife’s brothers.
Still, however, as the Duke of Argyle was old and
declining, and as Lord Lorne would lose the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
peerage<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> for ever, if he did not obtain it during
his father’s life, Mr. Conway would not oppose the
request; though, circumstanced as he was, he would
not ask it. It was immediately granted; and Lord
Chatham, by bending seasonably, took from the
Duke of Bedford’s scale the great Scottish interest
of the Campbells.</p>

<p>Towards the East India Company he was less
tractable. At a meeting of the proprietors many
warm speeches were made against him, particularly
by Wedderburne. They broke up in heat, and
adjourned for a fortnight, determined to make no
advances to Government, unless their right was
established, which Lord Chatham peremptorily refused
to allow. However, on the last day of the
year, they met again in smoother temper, and
agreed unanimously to empower the Directors of
the Company to treat immediately with the Administration.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang50 b2">Desultory Discussions on American and East Indian Affairs.—Debates
on the Land Tax.—Defeat of the Ministers.—Conduct of
Lord Chatham.—Offer made by the East India Company.—Motion
for Papers.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the Parliament met again on the 16th
of January, nothing was ready to be presented
for their discussion on the East India Company.
Lord Chatham, on his journey from Bath, was,
or pretended to be, seized with the gout, and
returned thither. Whether ill or not, it was plain
he had determined to give no directions, for he
sent none. He corresponded with none of the
Ministers; and they were not eager to anticipate
his intentions. The Duke of Grafton was charmed
to be idle, Conway was disgusted, Townshend delighted
in the prospect of confusion; however,
on the 21st Beckford laid before the House of
Commons the papers he intended to employ against
the Company. Townshend moved to have the
consideration put off for some time, to which
Beckford acquiesced.</p>

<p>On the 26th, the disposition of the troops in
America being laid before the House, Grenville<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
proposed that the Colonies should pay the regiments
employed there. Beckford told him he
was mad on the Stamp Act, and could think
of nothing else: Charles Townshend ridiculed and
exposed him infinitely on the same topic. Lord
George Sackville blaming the disposition of the
troops in that part of the world, Lord Granby
told him the plan had been drawn by his own
friend, General Amherst: the Court had a majority
of 106 to 35. The next day, on the report, Grenville,
dividing the House, had the mortification
of being followed but by sixteen members, the
Rockingham squadron declining union with him,
and the Bedfords being kept back by the Duchess,
still restless to return to Court.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of February the House of Lords
decided a great cause in favour of the Dissenters
against the City of London, who asserted a right
of fining them for refusing to act as Sheriffs;<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> Lord
Mansfield made another Whig oration.</p>

<p>It happened at this period that Mr. Conway,
who talked of nothing but resigning, became in
want of a secretary, William Burke quitting his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
service to follow his cousin Edmund into opposition.
My surprise was very great when Mr. Conway
declared his resolution of making David Hume,
the historian, who had served his brother, Lord
Hertford, in the same capacity at Paris, his secretary.
This by no means wore the air of an intention
to quit himself; Lord Hertford, I believe,
had started the thought, and on tracing the scent,
I found there had been some indirect negotiation
between the King and Lord Hertford to engage
Mr. Conway to be Prime Minister himself. Lord
Hertford thought his brother not averse to the
idea, though extremely weary of the Seals of Secretary.
Himself told me that the King had asked
him if Lord Chatham was not very tedious in Council,
and had complained of the long speeches he
made to him, as Mr. Grenville had been used to do.
Conway, no doubt, at three or four different periods,
might have been Minister; but though nobody
was inwardly more hurt at superiors, he never
had a settled ambition of being first, nor whenever
we talked to him with that view, could he
determine to yield to the temptation. I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
pleased, however, with the designation of Hume,
as it would give jealousy to the Rockinghams,
who had not acted wisely in letting Burke detach
himself from Mr. Conway; and I prevailed on
Lady Hertford to write a second letter, more
pressing than her Lord’s, to Mr. Hume to accept.
The philosopher did not want much entreaty; but it
was in vain that I laboured to preserve any harmony
between Lord Chatham and Conway; the <em>wildness</em>
of the former baffled all policy. On the 6th of
February Beckford was again forced to put off
the consideration of Indian affairs, and not a word
was said against it; his warmest opponents waiting
maliciously to see where this strange interlude
would end. Lord Chatham at last announced,
though he would not deign to send any answer
to the letters or solicitations of the Ministry, that
he would be in town on the 12th; Beckford, however,
gave out that he had received a letter from
him, which said the terms offered by the Company
were inadmissible;—they were left to guess in what
particulars. To Lord Bristol this mysterious Dictator
was more condescending, and wrote to him
that he would come, dead or alive—a notification
the more ridiculous, as having at last quitted Bath,
he was again seized with the gout, as he said, and
confined himself to the inn at Marlborough, still
inaccessible and invisible, though surrounded by
a train of domestics that occupied the whole inn,
and wore the appearance of a little Court. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
was the more remarked, as on his setting out from
Bath he had at first left most of his servants
behind, and they declared that they expected him
back.</p>

<p>The Opposition diverted themselves with the
novelty of this scene, and levelled their chief attacks
at Beckford, the substitute <em>out of place</em>, of a Minister
who <em>would</em> do no business. Burke indirectly shot
some of his arrows at Conway; and even out of the
House some satires on the Administration, in which
Conway was not spared, were strongly suspected
to come from the same quarter, and were much
resented by the latter.</p>

<p>On the 18th, on the North American extraordinaries,
Beckford was very abusive on George
Grenville. Rigby reproached Colonel Barré with
his <em>former</em> attacks on Lord Chatham, and with not
defending him now; and he taxed Charles Townshend
with his subjection to Lord Chatham, which
drew a fine oration from Townshend on his own
situation and on that of America. Grenville proposed
two addresses to the Crown, to call the garrisons
nearer to the capitals of each colony, and to employ
any money that should be obtained from the East
India Company in America. These motions were
rejected by 131 to 67.</p>

<p>On the 20th, Townshend again moved to put off
the East Indian affair, as the Company were on the
morrow to give an explanation of their former proposals.
Rigby asked, with a sneer, if the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
appointed hearing was to be definitive, and abused
Beckford in gross terms.</p>

<p>In the Lords the Duke of Bedford moved, on the
25th, for all correspondence with our Governors in
America. The Duke of Grafton promised they
should have all they could want; but the Chancellor,
sensible that the Duke had gone too far, endeavoured
to qualify the promise, and added, that
since the right of taxation (which himself had denied)
had been voted by Parliament, the Government
was obliged to support it.</p>

<p>The great majorities of the Court, notwithstanding
the inactivity of the Ministers, did not dishearten
the Opposition so much as that supineness encouraged
them to attempt a capital stroke. It was
conducted with the greatest secrecy, crowned with
incredible success, confounded the Administration,
produced not the smallest benefit to the successful
contrivers, but occasioned the expedient of another
measure, that gave a deep and lasting wound to the
country: not to mention that the perpetrators
themselves were sensible of the mischief they should
do in the first instance.</p>

<p>The land-tax is the surest fund of revenue to the
Government. It had usually been but two shillings
in the pound. The war and the increase of the
National Debt had mounted it to four shillings.
Grenville, during his Administration, in confidence
of his economic plans, and to lull the country
gentlemen with fair promises, had dropped that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
the land-tax, he believed, might be reduced in the
year 1767 to three shillings. If the country gentlemen
expected that alleviation, nobody else did;
nor could Grenville, had he remained Minister,
have realized the hopes he had thrown out. But
what he could not have effected himself, he was
now glad of distressing the Ministers by proposing.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a>
He and Rigby had artfully prepared a call of the
House against the day of voting the land-tax, in
order to bring to town the country Members, who
would not only be favourable to the diminution,
but must vote for it to please their electors, as the
Parliament was near its dissolution. The Tories,
too, though inclined to the Court, were become
enemies to Lord Chatham, who, having lost them
as soon as he lost his power, had treated them with
much contempt in his speeches on the Stamp Act.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
He had now trusted to his majorities, or that the
other Ministers would take care to secure them.
But besides that the land-tax had usually passed
as a matter of course, no care was taken to watch
the House of Commons. Conway, in the last
Administration, could not be induced to traffic with
Members, though offended that none of them paid
court to him; much less was he inclined now to
support Lord Chatham’s measures by any indirect
proceedings. The Duke of Grafton was cold and
ungracious; and having offered to repair to Marlborough,
and earnestly solicited permission to settle
the East Indian business with Lord Chatham, had
been peremptorily refused access.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></p>

<p>Under such a concurrence of untoward circumstances,
Charles Townshend proposed the usual
tax of four shillings on land, saying, that with
other savings and with what might be obtained
from the East India Company, Government would
be enabled to pay off the four per cents; and
pledging himself, that if he should remain Chancellor
of the Exchequer another year, he would be for
taking off one shilling from land. The Opposition
was opened by Dowdeswell, who moved for only
three shillings—a man who, having been so lately
the active Minister of the finances, knew but too
well how ill Government could afford to make the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
abatement.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> That very consideration weighed with
Lord Rockingham’s faction to join even their aversion,
Grenville. Edmund Burke alone had the
honesty to stay away rather than support so pernicious
a measure. Sir Edmund Isham<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> and Sir
Roger Newdigate,<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> half-converted Jacobites, declared,
as representatives of the Tories, for the
lesser sum, and the latter, to blacken Lord Chatham,
made a panegyric on Sir Robert Walpole. They
were answered extremely well by Lord North,
who began to be talked of for Chancellor of the
Exchequer. De Grey, Member for Norfolk, and
brother of the Attorney-General, in a strange
motley speech, in which he commended Grenville,
abused the Administration, blamed and commended
Lord Chatham, declared for the three
shillings, and vented much invective on eastern
and western governors, commissaries, and placemen,
who, he and Sir Roger Newdigate said, thrust all
the ancient families out of their estates. Beckford,
though one of the Members for the City of London,
on which the tax fell heaviest, yet said he would
concur in what was necessary for the State. Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
Clare showed that all taxes fall ultimately on land,
and that the measure of three shillings would be
popular only with gentlemen of estates, would not
ease labourers, farmers, artificers, and merchants.
He spoke with encomium of Lord Chatham, who
had first been represented as become insignificant
by his peerage, now was reviled as sole Minister.
Dr. Hay artfully took notice that Townshend had
said he would propose some tax this year on America.
Townshend explained, that it was to be done
by degrees and on mature consideration; but the
loss of the question of one shilling more on land
hurried Townshend into new taxes on America,
which not only were not well considered by himself
or the House, but furnished those repeated
occasions of disgust to America, or new pretences
for disgust, which opened again the wounds that
the repeal of the Stamp Act had closed, and reduced
the mother-country to more humiliations,
and even to employ the army in curbing their mutinous
brethren—happy if either experiment be tried
no farther than they have yet been at the end of
1769! Grenville made a great figure on this unhappy
question, and, throwing off all reserve about
Lord Chatham, remembered that the first year after
the Peace, he had asked why one shilling in the
pound was not taken off land?<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> He also detailed
all the savings himself had made, and said, he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
not answer Mr. Townshend, who had asked where
any new tax could be laid, with the end of an old
song, “Tell me, gentle shepherd, where?”<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> That
quotation had been much applauded; himself should
be hissed if he made such an answer; but it had
always, he said, been Lord Chatham’s style: he
would spend money, but left others to raise it.
A fool could ruin an estate, a fool and a knave
could ruin a nation. He was not gentle on Lord
North, who had deserted him for the Court. Conway
answered Grenville but indifferently; and
Lord John Cavendish closed the debate with an
affected point of honour, advising to lessen the
tax now, lest, if delayed till the next session, the
House should seem to court popularity at the eve
of a general election. At past nine at night the
House divided, and to the extreme surprise of
both sides, (for the Opposition had not dared
to flatter themselves with an idea of victory,) the
four shillings in the pound were lost by 188 to 206.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a>
The confidence of the Court had contributed to
their defeat, several of their friends, not doubting
of success, having voted against their inclination, to
please their constituents. Lord Granby and Sir
William Maynard<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> were almost the only members
for counties, who had dared to risk their popularity
by voting for the larger tax. Cooke, one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
representatives for Middlesex, though devoted to
Lord Chatham, had thought he might venture to
go against the Court. Thomas Pelham, with the
white stick in his hand, was forced by the Duke of
Newcastle, as Member for Sussex, to take the
same part. Some of the Duke of Grafton’s young
friends, not suspecting a contest, had gone out of
town that very day: but the most offensive blow to
the Crown was given by the Duke of York, who,
though his establishment was on the point of being
settled, allowed some of his own servants to fail
the Court, Colonel St. John,<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> one of the grooms of
his bedchamber, voting against it; and Cadogan,<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a>
his treasurer, attached to Grenville, and whose place
of surveyor of Kensington Garden had newly been
increased to 1000<i>l.</i> a year, absenting himself. Two
years afterwards, this same man had the modesty to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
accept a still more lucrative employment.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> Morton
too, a Tory, in whose favour Lord Chatham had
lately quashed an opposition at Abingdon, repaid
the service with similar gratitude.</p>

<p>This was the first important question lost by
the Crown since the fall of Sir Robert Walpole.
Mr. Pelham had been defeated in an inconsiderable
tax on sugar by the treachery of Lord Granville.
It was not less remarkable that the Crown,
which had been able to muster 224 votes in favour
of that crying grievance, General Warrants, found
but 188 ready to support a tax so essential to
Government, that it had been proved that unless
means could be found to lessen the debt, the nation
would be unable to engage in a new, however
necessary, war. The Bank was ready to advance
500,000<i>l.</i> on the land-tax; but the weightier these
arguments, the more obdurate the Opposition. Still
they had no other satisfaction than in the perpetration
of the mischief. No popularity ensued: the
City, where the national interest was best understood,
condemned such public disservice, and spread
the cry of disapprobation. Many who had lent
their voices to the Opposition, repented; and, what
the latter alone felt with shame, the Court recovered
its ascendant—a proof that surprise was
the only weapon their antagonists could use to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
effect, and against which the Ministers were now
put upon their guard. By Ministers I mean the
substitutes and the alarmed friends of Lord Bute.
Prone as he was to change and betray, he did not
choose to be compelled to change, nor to be taken
prisoner by Grenville and the Bedfords.</p>

<p>It was not impossible to have recovered the
question by recommitting it on the report, but the
Ministers did not think it prudent to venture.
Charles Townshend spoke on it only to protest
against the consequences of so destructive a resolution.
Between Lord North and Rigby some
wit passed that had no good humour for its foundation.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of March Lord Chatham arrived from
Marlborough. Any man in his senses would have
concluded, that, having felt the disastrous effects of
his inactivity, he had hurried to town to endeavour
to retrieve his influence in the House of Commons,
and to apply himself to more vigorous measures.
On the contrary, as if there was dignity in folly,
and magic in perverseness, as if the way to govern
mankind was to insult their understandings, his
conduct was the very reverse of common sense, and
made up of so much undissembled scorn of all the
world, that his friends could not palliate it, nor his
enemies be blamed for resolving it into madness.
He was scarce lame, and even paraded through the
town in a morning to take the air. Yet he neither
went to the King, nor suffered the Ministers to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
come to him.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> After much importunity he saw the
Duke of Grafton once or twice, but would not permit
the other Councillors to wait even in his antichamber.
A Cabinet Council being summoned on
the East Indian affair, nobody could prevail on
Lord Chatham to let it be held at his house. His
few intimates ascribed this ill-humour to his dissatisfaction
with Conway and Townshend, who had
declared they thought the Company had a right to
their conquests. Lord Chatham vowed he would
risk his situation on that question, and would defend
it himself in the House of Lords. Townshend went
so far as to be unwilling to dispute their right. Conway
was inclined to let them apprehend its being
questioned, that they might offer more largely to the
necessities of Government. Lord Chatham, who,
when obstinacy failed, knew not how to make himself
obeyed, privately waived the point of right, but
insisted on its not being told that he had relaxed.
His menaces, however, had so much effect, that the
directors offered to give up half their revenues and
half their trade, <em>with the right annexed</em>. These last
words were differently interpreted: some of the
Cabinet thinking the directors meant to waive,
others to save their right; and in that dilemma the
Cabinet broke up in confusion, though it was easy
to have asked the directors the meaning of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
own words. Conway declared he would not undertake
the conduct of that business, but would cede
his province to any man that would; and the King
telling Lord Hertford that he (his Majesty) must
support Lord Chatham, Conway and Townshend declined
going to the meetings that were held at the
Duke of Grafton’s on that subject. They were private
meetings of some of the leading men in the
House of Commons, the stiffness of Lord Chatham
having reduced him to seek for any men in the
subordinate class who would carry on the business—a
disgrace which, at the moment of having lost
a capital question, seemed sufficient to blast his
whole Administration. Conway had in vain pressed
for these meetings for four months together. Now,
when the question was within two days of appearing
in the House, no determination was taken, and
there was no Minister to carry it through. These
difficulties were increased by a rage for stock-jobbing
that had seized all ranks of men. It was more
shameful, that above sixty members who were to
sit in judgment on the Company, were known to
be engaged in that dirty practice. The Chancellor
of the Exchequer himself was vehemently suspected
of having caught the contagion.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<p>The day of expectation arrived at last, March the
6th—but ended in smoke. As Lord Chatham’s plan
was to be content with nothing the Company could
offer, that he might at last get the whole into his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
hands, or reduce them by force to cede a much
larger portion of their revenues than he could expect
they would offer till driven to that necessity,
he had eagerly rejected the plan presented by them
to the Treasury; and Beckford now, to obtain from
the House disapprobation of those offers, moved to
have all papers, that had passed between the Government
and the Company for the last six months,
laid before the House. This motion, which had the
sanction of the Ministry, for it was seconded by
Colonel Fitzroy, was not only disapproved of by
the Opposition, (who treated it as a measure of delay
in Beckford, during the ill-humour of his friend
Lord Chatham, and as a matter nugatory, since the
paper being only an offer from the Treasurer of the
Company to the Treasury, it was not an act of the
General Court, and could consequently be disavowed
by the proprietors,) but was objected to by
Charles Townshend too, as the measure was incomplete;
questions, he said, being asked on the proposals,
and answers still more obscure returned.
And to show his dissatisfaction, he desired the
House to consider him as a private Member of
Parliament. Conway, with more decency, let it be
perceived that he was not much better content;
however, to disculpate his friend the Duke of Grafton,
he said, the Duke had warned the directors that
the paper would come before Parliament, nor would
accept it till they allowed of that condition. His
own opinion, he said, he would not declare. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
understood the proposal as yet was neither rejected
nor accepted. He wished not to see the paper in
the House, till either rejected or accepted; lamented
the step taken, but could not obstruct it. Charles
Yorke vindicated the Company. Grenville, Burke,
and Wedderburne treated Chatham and Beckford
with scorn, and laboured to raise a spirit against the
idea of force to be put on the Company, and to
baffle any benefit being received by the Government.
In the midst of the debate, the military and naval
chiefs, by their posts members of the Cabinet, but
with all their merits very incompetent judges of
state affairs, and still worse qualified to engage in
the subtleties of a Parliamentary discussion,—both,
I say, Lord Granby and Sir Edward Hawke blabbed
out the secret which the Ministers were veiling, and
which even the treachery and loquacity of Townshend
had not dared openly to disclose. Lord
Granby told the House that the offers had been
found inadmissible; and Sir Edward, to engage the
House to send for the paper, declared that the majority
of the Council had rejected it. These blunders
defeated Lord Chatham’s view, which was to
steal the disapprobation of the House, or at worst,
should the House admit the proposal, he would
stand disculpated to the public for having made no
better a bargain. This unlucky truth divulged,
drew much ridicule on the managers; and now the
secret was out, the Opposition suffered the motion
to pass without a negative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
The adversaries, however, had not so soon forgotten
to what they had owed their late success; and
having acquiesced in the printing of the papers, they
flattered themselves the Ministers would the less
expect an attack in that quarter. Accordingly, on
the 9th, Jones,<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> an East Indian director, a tool of
Lord Sandwich, presented a petition from the Company,
by surprise, against printing their papers,
pleading that it would disclose their secrets to their
enemies. Townshend was absent, and the whole
weight of the day fell on Conway, who extricated
himself from so delicate a situation with the utmost
ability. Allowing greatly, as was his nature, to candour,
he called on the directors to point out particular
papers that might be prejudicial to them, and
which, he said, he should certainly be against printing.
He disclaimed violence; but observed, as did
others, that their papers told nothing more than
was published every day in two occasional papers
called <cite>The India Observer</cite> and <cite>The Examiner</cite>. Jones
denying that the directors allowed the Duke of
Grafton to lay their proposals before the House,
and Grenville pleading that had he known <em>that</em> the
other day, he would not have voted for the printing,
Conway and Lord Granby both affirmed that the
Duke had refused on any other condition to receive
their proposal; and Jones, being pressed to answer
why he had not contradicted their assertion on the
last debate, had nothing to say but that they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
never expressed in words allowance of exposing
their paper, and that he had not ventured the
other day to take on himself to make objections,
but had stayed till he could consult his brethren.
Grenville quoted the precedent of reversing the
order for printing the American papers, and others;
the danger of informing France and the Mogul of
the state of the Company’s transactions: but it was
showed how much more they must know, the first,
by the publications of Scrafton<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> and others of the
Company, the latter by his situation. Rigby attacked
the Ministers on their disunion, which was
finely turned by Conway against him, the complaints
of the Opposition having run till now on a
sole dictator. Elliot distinguished himself on the
same subject; and, after a debate till nine at night,
the Ministers disappointed the intended surprisal,
and maintained their order for printing the papers
by a majority of 180 to 147.</p>

<p>When thus triumphant, in spite of his own absurdities,
and of the variations of Charles Townshend,
who now spoke of himself as turned out, and
who only spoke so because he thought himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
secure of not being turned out, it was evident what
Lord Chatham might have done, had he known
how to make the most of his situation. He might
have given firmness and almost tranquillity to his
country; might have gone farther towards recruiting
our finances than any reasonable man could have expected;
and, in indulgence of his own lofty visions,
might have placed himself in—at least have restored
Great Britain to, a situation of reassuming that
credit which he and chance had given her some years
before. But, alas! his talents were inadequate to
the task. The multiplication-table did not admit
of being treated in epic, and Lord Chatham had
but that one style. Whether really out of his
senses, or conscious how much the mountebank had
concurred to form the great man, he plunged deeper
and deeper into retreat, and left the nation a prey
to faction, and to the insufficient persons that he
had chosen for his coadjutors. Once, and but once,
he saw the King after having refused a visit from
Conway, though commissioned by his Majesty to
talk with him on Russian negotiations. On the
state of America he would hear him as little, and
would give no answer but the same he had on East
Indian affairs, <em>that it would find its way through the
House</em>. Conway protested he would not conduct it
there, unless some plan was previously settled, and
he knew what he was to support. With Townshend
Conway had little less difficulty; the former sometimes
pressing him to resign, sometimes threatening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
to resign and leave him alone; and at others
reproaching him for not undertaking his defence
when he thought himself the most obliquely hinted
at: for Townshend, though as prone to draw reflections
on himself as Conway was sedulous not to deserve
them, was equally tender and jealous of criticism.</p>

<p>Though the chief business of the session turned
on the great affair of what was to be gotten from the
Company, yet as what was gotten, was at least
peaceably obtained without violence or any Parliamentary
decision on their rights; and as I avow
myself extremely unversed in those and all other
transactions of money and revenue, I shall, as much
as I can, avoid details on that subject, both in favour
of my own ignorance, and to avoid misleading the
reader; the spirit of the times, and the characters
of the men who gave colour to events, being almost
my sole objects in these Memoirs. The reader has
seen, and will see, through what a labyrinth of faction,
self-interest, and misconduct we were led into
such a chaos of difficulties, as God knows whether
I shall live to see surmounted;<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> or whether I must
not leave these pages a sad memorial of those errors
whose consequences posterity may trace back to
their several sources. If I pause a moment to
make this reflection, it is because I think at this
period Lord Chatham, by a wise and vigorous exertion
of himself, might still have established some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
permanent system, with the support of the Crown
and the Favourite, without too disgraceful dependence
on the latter. I think so, because even the
remnant of this system, when Lord Chatham was
withdrawn, still maintained its superiority. That
Lord Chatham might have done much more service
nine months earlier, before his wanton defiance of
the Rockingham party, and his other wild actions of
passion and scorn, is past a doubt with me. It will
appear at a period not much later, that had his
successor and pupil not been endued with almost
as great impracticability, and scarce less haughtiness,
the distractions that followed had never happened.
They indeed dated from a subsequent Parliament;
but the seeds were sown in that complaisant
and prostitute one of which I am speaking,
and which yet, if well conducted, might have remedied
many of the evils it had countenanced; but
managed as it was, it left nothing but the dis-esteem
it had raised to be copied by, and stigmatised in,
the Parliament that succeeded.</p>

<p>On the 11th Dudley and Rouse, the chairman
and deputy-chairman of the Company, appeared
before the House, and declaring they thought that
the printing of any of their papers, except the
Charters and Firmans, might be prejudicial to their
affairs, Conway candidly desired the House would
retract the order for printing them, and it was
agreed to: he having wished for a sight of all
charters, Norton eagerly seized the proposal, Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
Mansfield—ever hostile to Lord Chatham—having
discovered in one of the oldest charters that a power
had been granted to the Company of making war,
and the old Company had transferred all their rights
to the new. Dempster, and the younger Burke,
who had engaged deeply in India Stock, were the
persons that gave the greatest opposition to the
pursuits of the Ministers. Edmund Burke, too,
assisted by the friendship of Lord Verney, trafficked
in the same funds, and made a considerable fortune,
most part of which he lost again afterwards by a
new fluctuation in the same transactions,<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> and which
probably produced, as will be seen, another revolution
in the factions of these times. Sullivan, a
leading personage in Indian affairs, sought by various
proposals to get the negotiation into his own hands,
but those subordinate intrigues are foreign to my
purpose.</p>

<p>During these altercations, and while the time
necessary for calling and holding courts of directors
or proprietors delayed the prosecution of this matter,
the King sent a message to both Houses,
desiring them to make a provision for his brothers.
The message was taken into consideration on the
19th, and in each House Lord Temple and Mr.
Grenville objected to the establishment being
entailed on the issue of the Princes. On the 24th,
when it was to be voted, Mr. Grenville, without
directly opposing, made a very able speech and
observations on the settlement. It would be an
additional expense, he said, of 24,000<i>l.</i> a year on
the Civil List, and might have been saved from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
other articles. The charge of ambassadors might
be reduced, who each cost the Crown 13,000<i>l.</i> the
first year. He ridiculed Lord Chatham’s magnificent
plans of naming ambassadors to various Courts,
and despatching none of them. He had threatened
to dissolve the Family-compact; yet Sir James Grey
was not yet set out for Spain, nor Mr. Lyttelton<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> for
Portugal. Turn north, there were the same great
plans, yet Mr. Stanley was not gone. Mr. George
Pitt was alike absent from Turin; to those gentlemen
he professed meaning nothing personal: the
Chancellor of the Exchequer must pay them, and
they were in the departments of the Secretaries
of State, who, though in responsible places, he was
sure were not to blame. The pensions on Ireland
amounted to 88,000<i>l.</i> a year; the revenue of that
country ought to be laid out to support the Royal
Family, and Ireland would like it. Stanley, a very
warm man, took this invective to himself, and
showed how much he resented it. He complained
that Grenville had given him no notice of the
intended attack, and observed how delicate his own
situation was in speaking, or not speaking, between
private honour and the duty he owed to the King
of secrecy. He did not care, he said, whether the
attack was pointed at him, or to wound another
through him; the employment he had not sought:
in France he had served to his loss, and was ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
to have his conduct inquired into. Had Lord Egremont
(Grenville’s brother-in-law) gone, when he
was named to the congress at Augsbourg? Foreign
Ministers had no means of raising a fortune. Had
he himself a son he would say to him, “Get into Parliament,
make tiresome speeches; you will have great
offers; do not accept them at first,—then do; then
make great provision for yourself and family, and then
call yourself an independent country gentleman.”
For himself, he was ready to answer Mr. Grenville
there or anywhere else. Severe as the picture
was, Grenville had drawn it on himself, resenting
Stanley’s having left him for Lord Chatham. Nor
could Stanley be blamed for taking offence; he had
been represented in a disgraceful light, while he
had acted with singular honour, and yet was not
at liberty to disculpate himself. The fact stood
thus: Lord Chatham, as I have said, full of a grand
northern alliance, had named Stanley Minister to
both the Russian and Prussian Courts. The latter
would not receive him: the Czarina did not like
the proposed alliance, nor the expense of sending
an ambassador in return: yet had she named
Prince Czernicheff. Sir George Maccartney had
desired leave to come home; and thus Stanley stood
on the list as ambassador, in compliment to the
nomination of an ambassador from St. Petersburg;
yet, perceiving he was not to go, he had honourably
refused to take the appointments; a state secret
he could not disclose, as it would be telling the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
Russian Court that there was no longer an intention
of sending him. Dowdeswell spoke in favour of
the Princes, as he was to have made the same
motion the foregoing spring. Sir Roger Newdigate,
in a dull metaphorical speech, abused the Administration,
and complimented Grenville. Charles
Townshend turned him into the highest ridicule,
analysing his metaphors, and reducing them and
the whole speech, as it deserved, to nonsense.
Newdigate replied, and with the obstinacy of dulness
professed he had never admired any Administration
but Grenville’s. Townshend enforced what he
had said with new ridicule: the settlement was
granted, and the King saved 9000<i>l.</i> a year.</p>

<p>A melancholy event relaxed a little the assiduity
of the Opposition. The Marquis of Tavistock,<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> only
son of the Duke of Bedford, was thrown from his
horse as he was hunting, and received a kick that
fractured his skull. He languished about a fortnight,
and died at the age of twenty-seven. If
there was a perfectly amiable and unblemished
character in an age so full of censure, and so much
deserving it, the universal esteem in which the
virtues of that young Lord were held, seemed to
allow that he was the person. His gentleness,
generosity, and strict integrity made all the world
love or admire him. Full of spirit and martial
ardour, which he suppressed in deference to a father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
to whom his life was so important, he had the
genuine bashfulness of youth, and the humility of
the lowest fortune. His large fortune he shared
with his cotemporary friends, assisting them in
purchasing commissions. Yet he had taste for
those arts whose excellence and splendour became
the House of so great an heir, and indulged himself
in them when they did not interfere with his more
favourite liberality. His parts were neither shining
nor contemptible; and his virtue assisted his understanding
in preserving both from being biassed or
seduced. To observers, it was clear that he much
disapproved the want of principle in the relations
and dependants<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> of his parents; yet so respectful
was his duty to his father, and so attentive his tenderness
to his mother, and so artfully had she impressed
it, that Lord Tavistock’s repugnance to their
connections and politics was only observable by his
shunning Parliament, and by withdrawing himself
from their society to hunting and country sports.
He was not less exemplary as a husband than as
a son, and his widow, who doated on so excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
a young man, survived him but two years.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> The
indecent indifference with which such a catastrophe
was felt by the faction of the family, spoke but too
plainly that Lord Tavistock had lived a reproach
and terror to them. The Duke, his father, for a
few days almost lost his senses—and recovered
them too soon. The Duchess was less blameable,
and retained the impression longer; but while all
mankind who ever heard the name of Lord Tavistock
were profuse in lamenting such a national calamity,
it gave universal scandal when, in a little fortnight
after his death, they beheld his father, the
Duke, carried by his creatures to the India House
to vote on a factious question. This unexampled
insensibility was bitterly pressed home on the
Duke two years afterwards in a public libel. Yet
surely, it was savage wantonness to taunt a parent
with such a misfortune; and of flint must the
heart have been that could think such a domestic
stroke a proper subject for insult, however inadequate
to the world the anguish appeared: how
steeled the nature that could wish to recall the
feelings of a father on such a misfortune. In
Borgia’s age they stabbed with daggers; in ours
with the pen!<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
About the same time died the widow Dauphiness,
a pious but unamiable Princess, and only remarkable
for the various fortune that attended her.
Daughter of Augustus of Poland, she was married
into the same Court, where the daughter of her
father’s rival, Stanislaus, was Queen. Received and
treated with affection by that Princess, and possessing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
all the tenderness of her husband, her fruitfulness
seemed to ensure her felicity; when, though
seated on the step of the most formidable throne in
Europe, she beheld her father again driven into
exile, and her mother dying in the midst of that
calamity. Her family were scarce restored when
the Dauphin perished before her eyes of a lingering
illness; and she outlived him too short a time
to be secure that the youth of her children would
not expose them to the dangers that attend a
minority.</p>

<p>The disputes in the East India Company, which
grew out of their great cause before the Parliament,
produced an attack on Lord Clive, his enemies
attempting to seize the Jaghire that had been
granted to him by the Mogul; and it was but by a
majority of about 30 voices that he saved that immense
revenue on a ballot, 361 voting for the continuation
of it for ten years, and 330 against it.</p>

<p>Towards the end of March the House began
reading the East Indian papers that had been laid
before them; each day of which produced much
general debate, especially as witnesses were examined.
The Attorney-General De Grey and Dyson
shone on these occasions, and showed how much
the question was a matter of state, and that the
King’s Bench could have no judicature over the
East Indies. Governor Vansittart<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> was examined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
for four hours, and gave much satisfaction: his evidence
tended to strengthen the right of the Crown,
and brought over many persons to that side. Colonel
Monroe spoke strongly in his deposition to the
same effect.</p>

<p>In the mean time the faction of Grenville and
the Bedfords, humbled by the death of Lord Tavistock,
and by the ground gained against them on the
India question, began to cast about for real union
with the Rockinghams. The latter, on the first
overtures, and without any positive assurance of
that union, sought to draw Mr. Conway into the
league, affirming that Grenville, as they had lightly
been made to believe, would be content with some
inferior post, and would waive his hopes of being
Minister. Conway, however, discontented with
Lord Chatham, and fearful of offending his old
friends, did not listen to a plan so improbable in
its construction, and so dishonourable in its tendency.
Grenville could only mean to get to Court
with the view of undermining his associates when
he should be there: and such a treaty would be
unpardonable in Conway, while acting in the King’s
service. He would not allow himself to think of
the Treasury, which he knew Lord Rockingham
would never cede to him; and yet on talking over
the proposed arrangement with him, he said sensibly,
and not unambitiously, “If I should join them, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
would insist on Grenville going into the House of
Lords.” He was not without fears of Grenville and
Rockingham uniting and leaving him with Lord Chatham
and Lord Bute. I was not so easily alarmed,
though the Duke of Richmond endeavoured to persuade
me that the junction would certainly take
place, and that Conway would not even recover his
regiment. I saw no danger comparable to that of
his resigning, and consequently of dissolving the
Administration; and very little to apprehend from
the union of two men whom so many reasons
divided, and whom the predominant one of both
aiming at the first place must for ever keep asunder.
So it happened then. Neither would yield a post
which neither saw a prospect of attaining by his own
strength. Grenville at last proposed that both
should desist, and should agree in the nomination
of a third person. This, no doubt, he intended
should be his own brother, Temple, who might afterwards
resign to him. But the least proper was
the most obstinate, and the treaty came to nothing.
I put the Duke of Richmond in mind of what Lord
Gower had said the last year, and asked him if he
thought it likely that the Bedfords would enlist
under a man who was so much their contempt?
Lord Sandwich having abused Lord Rockingham
in the House of Lords, Lord Gower said to him,
“Sandwich, how could you worry the poor dumb
creature so!”</p>

<p>A question of more importance than the Indian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
one was now to come on the carpet—the Regulation
of America. The repeal of the Stamp Act, however
necessary and salutary, had, as Grenville and his
adherents foretold, instead of pacifying that continent,
inspired the turbulent with presumption.
With whatever joy the repeal had been received,
it was not followed by that general gratitude to the
Ministers who obtained it, which they deserved.
Great Britain having yielded, the tribunes of America
flattered themselves that new concessions might
be extorted: so certain is the march of successful
patriotism towards acquisition. Still the disturbances
were not alarming nor universal: and if, instead
of tampering with a wound not closed, emollients,
restoratives, at least oblivion, and no farther
essays at taxes had succeeded, harmony perhaps had
again taken place. A Ministry composed of heterogeneous
particles, some inclination to show authority
after mildness, an eagerness to replace the loss
on the land-tax, and, above all, the inconsiderate
vanity of Charles Townshend, and not a small propensity
in him to pay court to Grenville, all concurred
to prompt rash and indigested measures;
while a Parliament, so obsequious as that of the
moment, was ready to enact every successive contradiction
that was proposed to it by the Court, and
eased Ministers of the trouble of weighing the plans
they intended to pursue. Nay, the circumstances
of the time recommended violence as the least
obnoxious measure; Grenville being sure to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
less obstruction to any intemperance which resembled
his own, and secretly enjoying any indiscretion
that would involve his successors in
the same difficulties as those he had occasioned
himself.</p>

<p>The first plan on which the Ministers fixed was
that of force and punishment. They proposed to
oblige the Provinces to furnish beer and vinegar
to the soldiers; and if they refused, the governor
of New York was to be prohibited from giving
the royal assent for holding their assemblies. This
step would, in effect, have been a dissolution of
their government, and not less violent than the
seizure of charters by Charles II. When the scheme
was laid before the Cabinet, Conway, who adhered
to the conciliating measures of the last year, and
to his own mild maxims, alone opposed so arbitrary
a project. When,</p>

<p>On the 30th of the month, the American papers
which had been laid before the Houses, were taken
into consideration by the Lords. The Chancellor
opened the nature of them, and hinting at the
disobedience of the Colonies, said, if his own sentiments
should not be so lenient as formerly, it was
because he had formed them anew on the Act
passed in the last session. Lord Weymouth observed
to him, sensibly, that last year’s had not
been an Act but a Declaration. Lord Temple
was more acrimonious, his language gross, telling
the Chancellor that his former opinion of Parliament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
having <em>no right</em> to tax the Colonies, had been
treasonable. The Duke of Grafton defended the
Chancellor with great propriety, and asked why
Lord Temple had not called him, if guilty of treason,
to the bar? He reproached Temple, too, with
blackening a most respectable character (Lord
Chatham’s), from revenge. The present question,
he said, was too serious for faction; but if places
were the objects of opposition, and if his would
reconcile Lord Temple, it was at his service. These
bickerings were all that passed then. Lord Denbigh
called on the Opposition to propose some plan
for restoring the tranquillity and submission of
America; but neither party were eager to stir in
it: the Ministers were afraid, the Opposition
apprehended disunion amongst themselves,—so different
were the sentiments of Grenville and Rockingham
on that subject.</p>

<p>When the settlement on the Princes passed the
House of Lords, Lord Temple behaved with his
usual violence. Great and deserved reflections were
thrown on Lord Northington for his scandalous
extortion of emoluments on the late change. Lord
Temple then caused the House to be summoned
without acquainting them to what purpose.</p>

<p>The same day, his brother and the Opposition
debated in the Commons against delay on the East
Indian affair till eight in the evening, and then divided
the House for calling in witnesses. Many of
the courtiers had gone away, and the motion was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
rejected but by 96 to 82! Sir W. Meredith then
declared, that if Beckford did not by that day sevennight
ascertain the House when he would bring
on his questions, he would move to dissolve the
Committee. Such inconsistent conduct in the Opposition
was occasioned by its having appeared on
the examination, that the Crown would be justifiable
in seizing the acquisitions of the Company,
so crying were the abuses, and so little was the
Company itself master of its own servants. Easter,
too, was now approaching, and the Opposition feared
not being able to rally their forces after the holidays.
Grenville, apprehending from so many concurrent
circumstances favourable to Lord Chatham, that he
would be able to acquire a large revenue to the
Crown, laboured to instil fears of such intended
force; saying, the East Indian business had begun
in folly, and would end in violence.</p>

<p>Lord Chatham himself either was not, or would
not be, in a condition to strike any great stroke.
Though he still continued to take the air publicly,
his spirits and nerves were said to be in the lowest
and most shattered condition. Added to the
phrenzy of his conduct, a new circumstance raised
general suspicion of there being more of madness
in his case, than mere caprice and impracticable
haughtiness: he had put himself into the
hands of Dr. Addington—a regular physician, it is
true, but originally a mad doctor, innovating enough
in his practice to be justly deemed a quack. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
physician, it was supposed, was selected as proper
to the disease; whereas, if all was not a farce, I
should think that the physician rather caused the
disease, Addington having kept off the gout, and
possibly dispersed it through his nerves, or even
driven it up to his head. So long did Lord Chatham
remain without a fit of the gout, and so childish and
agitated was his whole frame, if a word of business
was mentioned to him, tears and trembling immediately
succeeded to cheerful, indifferent conversation.
Some passages, too, which I shall specify
hereafter, indicated a fond kind of dotage; yet do I
very much doubt whether the whole scene was not
imposition, and the dictates of disappointment, inability,
and pride, rather than the fruits of a brain
extraordinarily distempered. A slave to his passions,
a master dissembler, and no profound statesman,
his conduct was more likely to be extravagant by
design than from the loss of his senses. As he
reappeared in the world, and yet governed his
domestic affairs with the same wild wantonness
and prodigality, it is probable that there was not
more folly in his secession from business, than could
be accounted for in so eccentric a composition. If
it was nothing but singularity and passion, Lord
Chatham was certainly the first man who ever retired
from business into the post of Prime Minister.</p>

<p>As I suspected that much of this ill-humour was
founded on his disappointment in Mr. Conway, who
would not receive orders from behind the veil of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sanctum sanctorum</i>, and as I had heard that
the Chancellor complained much of the latter, I
desired to wait on Lord Camden, in order if possible
to restore some harmony in the Administration.
Having appointed me an hour, I offered all that
depended on me towards reconciling my friend and
Lord Chatham. The Chancellor by no means aided
my good disposition. He complained much of Mr.
Conway’s niceties, difficulties, and impracticability.
In truth Mr. Conway allowed too much to his scruples,
and the Chancellor on the other hand was a little
too alert in relaxing his former principles; the one
leaning towards power, the other to popularity: yet
I think even the Chancellor was too much addicted
to the latter, to have risked it by any signal servility.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a>
He was generally firm, when pushed by the roughness
of the times. A moderate degree of attention
to his fortune stole into his conduct, when it did not
too much clash with his professions or connections.
He told me that Lord Chatham was very willing to
replace Mr. Conway in the army; and being but a
novice in politics, he let drop indiscreetly, that if
the Ministers could weather the session, there must
be a totally new Administration; adding, that Mr.
Conway’s behaviour on the East Indian affair had
been a stab to Lord Chatham, and had reduced him
to lean on Lord Bute.</p>

<p>Though I did not know whether this imprudent
declaration implied an intention of co-operating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
entirely with Bute, or might not look towards
Grenville, yet I saw plainly that there was an intention
of getting rid of Mr. Conway. I took no
notice either to the Chancellor or to Mr. Conway
of what I had discovered, lest the latter should
resign immediately; but I instantly determined to
keep Conway steady to his last year’s point of moderation
towards America. It would preserve his
connection with his old friends, who would be
necessary to him, if Lord Chatham broke with
him; and it was essential to him to maintain his
character. Accordingly I softened extremely towards
the Rockingham party, and talked to them
of the necessity of Mr. Conway and their agreeing,
as they had done when in Administration together,
to oppose any violence against the Americans.
This plan succeeded extraordinarily, and blasted
all thoughts of union between Grenville and Rockingham,
the former of whom had endeavoured to
persuade the latter to content himself with a dukedom
and the lieutenancy of Ireland. Nor was this
all the success that attended the secret the Chancellor
had blabbed to me. It occasioned such a
breach in and discomfiture of the Opposition, as
carried the Administration through the session with
triumph. So often did chance throw occasions in
my way, which no policy of mine could have super-induced,
and which, if I preferred vanity to truth,
I might represent as the effects of profound craft
and foresight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
On the 10th of April, in consequence of Lord
Temple’s summons, the Duke of Bedford moved to
address the King to order the Privy Council to
take into their consideration a recent Act of the
Assembly of the Massachusets, in which they had
taken on themselves to pardon the late insurrections,
and to couple with that Act an ordinance
for raising of money. Lord Northington affirmed,
that the consideration of those Acts was still before
the Board of Trade; on which the Duke of Grafton
moved the previous question. In reply to a reproach
made by the Duke of Bedford on the delays
and inactivity of Administration, Grafton decently
hinted, and it was fresh in everybody’s memory,
how handsomely he had put off the American question
on Lord Tavistock’s accident. Lord Halifax
rudely and inconsiderately censured Conway for not
having transmitted the orders of their Lordships to
the Colonies. In fact, the orders had not been sent
to Conway; and Halifax, the accuser, had, when
Secretary of State himself, neglected orders committed
to him by the King in Council. The Duke
of Richmond warmly took up Conway’s defence,
and led the way to a separation from the other part
of the Opposition. Lord Talbot gave up all the
Ministers but the Duke of Grafton. Lord Mansfield
spoke finely for the motion; the Chancellor
well, for acting with spirit against the Colonies; but
said it would require great prudence to conduct
that spirit. Lord Suffolk and Lord Lyttelton supported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
the motion. Lord Shelburne and Lord
Botetort were against it, and Lord Townshend for
it. It was rejected by the previous question, on a
majority of 63 to 36. The Duke of Richmond,
Lord Rockingham, Lord Dartmouth, Lord Monson,
Lord Radnor, and Lord Edgcumbe voting with the
Court; the Duke of Newcastle, who leaned to
the Bedfords, Lord Albemarle, and others of the
party, retiring. Lord Hardwicke voted with the
minority.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></p>

<p>On this schism, I again pressed Conway to join
the Rockinghams on the American question, and
hinted my suspicion, not my knowledge, that Lord
Chatham might think of dismissing him at the end
of the session. Conway was enough disposed to
that union; said he could not negotiate himself,
but consented that I should sound the Duke of
Richmond, and wished their faction would not insist
on that unattainable point, the total dismission
of Lord Bute’s friends. I found the Duke much
incensed against Lord Temple for not having communicated
to them the late motion, and provoked
that Rigby, who had negotiated with them on
Grenville’s part, and at first had waived the Treasury
for him, had at last insisted on it. I pressed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
Grace to try by his cousin Albemarle’s means
to gain the Bedfords separately from Grenville.
Conway wished that junction and separation. I
did not at all think it practicable; but I hoped
that the proposal, coming from the Rockinghams,
would exasperate Grenville and widen the breach
between them. The Duke approved and was eager
for that alliance, but demanded that Conway should
resign first, as many of their friends were averse to
him while he acted with Lord Chatham. I advised
him to try it himself with Conway, though I told
him I would not answer for the success: but I would
not undertake what I intended to impede; expecting
that Lord Chatham would not be able to continue
in power, and that then it must devolve on
Conway: and choosing that the Rockinghams should
accede to him, not he go over to them. Neither
happened. I did not accomplish the junction; but
I both kept Conway from resigning, and the Rockinghams
from uniting with Grenville and the Bedfords.</p>

He was a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford, until his death
in 1813, at a very advanced age. Flattering obituaries appear
of him in the Annual Register and the Gentleman’s Magazine of
that year. A clergyman of his College, now deceased, described
him to a friend of the Editor “as an honest, high-principled man,
but a dull talker, and a prosy speaker.”—E.]</p></div>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> In his eighty-third year. His old age was lonely and unattractive,
being passed in the society of a few obsequious bishops
and blue-stocking ladies, with whom he kept up a sickly commerce
of flattery. His zenith had been bright: his decline was
not mild. Avarice tormented even his last hours, and it is
painful to witness, in his correspondence, how entirely he was
subjected to that baleful passion. It degraded his nature, and
almost disturbed his reason, for on no other ground can some of
his acts be explained. His character as a politician was too severely
censured by his cotemporaries, but in private life he was
mean, selfish, and sordid, to an extent almost commensurate with
his great abilities and attainments.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> When the first part of these Memoirs was written there had
not transpired the smallest idea of D’Eon being a woman, nor
when that secret was first broached did it gain credit. Some years
also elapsed before the fact was allowed, and it was some time before
the dubious person assumed the female habit, and then only
by command of the Court of France. I have not chosen to correct
my narrative, not only because the change of sex did not happen
till the personage had ceased to figure in an historic light, but because,
having no notion of that doubtful gender at the time of
her eccentric behaviour, my account will remain more natural,
and does paint the general sensation produced by her exploits.
The Government here acted as I have written, totally in the dark
as to a false assumption of sex. [In 1777 an action was brought
by a surgeon named Hayes against Jacques, a baker, who had
received fifteen guineas to return one hundred guineas if it should
be proved that the Chevalier was a woman; and the evidence
of that fact was so strong that the jury decided in favour of
Hayes. There were other actions on the same point, but they
were disposed of by the Court, very properly, declaring these
wagers to be illegal. Da Costa <i>v.</i> Jones, Cowper’s Reports, 729.—The
Annual Register, p. 167, evidently copying some newspaper,
says, “by this decision no less a sum than 75,000<i>l.</i> will
remain in this country, which would otherwise have been transmitted
to Paris.” The same authority says, “Aug. 16th, the Chevalier
left England, declaring that she had no interest whatever
in the policies opened on her sex.” From that time till the death
of the Chevalier he was always believed to be a woman, and dressed
as such. The post mortem examination, which is stated in the
Gent. Mag. vol. lxxx. p. 588, proved him to be a perfect male.
He was never employed after his disgrace; but having been long
a spy of Louis the Fifteenth, it was not deemed prudent to drive
him to despair, and a handsome pension was granted to him, which
he enjoyed till the Revolution. He then took refuge in England,
and was afterwards reduced to great poverty. He died in London,
at a very advanced age, in 1810. There is an interesting note on
Chev. d’Eon by Mr. Croker in Walpole’s collected Correspondence,
vol. iv. p. 323. See also the article, a very partial one, in
the Biographie Universelle.—E.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> The Count d’Estaign had broken his parole in India, and, having
been again taken prisoner, was kept in close confinement at
Portsmouth—a treatment of which he very unreasonably complained
as harsh and unjustifiable. His name often occurs in the
history of the American war, in which he commanded the French
fleet with some reputation. He claimed a victory over Admiral
Byron. During the French Revolution he acted a very vacillating,
if not dishonest, part; and, having given offence both to Royalists
and Republicans, he was brought to the scaffold in 1794, aged 65.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Mr. Legge did not write the narrative mentioned in the text.
It is the composition of the Bishop of Hereford, his intimate friend,
to whom he committed on his death-bed “the publication of the
papers that explained his case;” or, in other words, his correspondence
with Lord Bute respecting the Hampshire election. (Some
account of the Life of the Right Hon. Bilson Legge.) His object
being, not, as Walpole supposes, to fix on Lord Bute the charge of
meddling with elections, but to clear his own character from various
insinuations, by showing, from the correspondence, that his refusal
to yield to Lord Bute’s dictation in the Hampshire election, was
the real cause of his disgrace, and that he might have remained in
office if he had chosen to disgrace himself by taking the opposite
course. The Bishop’s observations explanatory of the transaction
are in the spirit that might be expected from a prelate not indisposed
to translation, when treating of the conduct of those who
dispense ecclesiastical patronage. To make up, however, for his
courtesy towards his patron’s adversaries, he heaps unmeasured eulogy
upon his patron’s memory. It is now, indeed, pretty well
understood that Mr. Legge had no title to a tithe of the merits
ascribed to him by his right reverend biographer. He was a very
useful statesman. (See supra, p. 39.) His head, as Sir Robert
Walpole said of him, had very little rubbish in it. He was good-natured,
and easy in social intercourse. To exalted patriotism he
never raised any pretensions; and whatever may be the Bishop’s
opinion, the friend and boon companion of Wilkes could be no
pattern of religion or morality.—E.</p></div>

forty-four. The scanty praise awarded him in the text is far below
his due. He had been Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1755, and
First Lord of the Treasury in the following year. “In the ordinary
business of his office,” says Lord Waldegrave, “he shewed
great punctuality and diligence, and no want of capacity.”—Memoirs,
p. 141. A strong sense of responsibility, and a natural
diffidence in his own talents, accompanied by a dislike for business,
and an indifference to ministerial employments, gave him, at times,
an air of indecision rather ungraceful; but he could be firm on
great occasions, and his public no less than his private life was
distinguished by unsullied uprightness and honour.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> What authority Walpole had for this assertion does not

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> Dr. Johnson, a violent political opponent, observed of him,
“that he was not a man of superior abilities, but he was a man
strictly faithful to his word. If, for instance, he had promised you
an acorn, and none had grown that year in his woods, he would
not have contented himself with that excuse. He would have
sent to Denmark for it. So unconditional was he in keeping his
word—so high as to the point of honour.”—Boswell’s Life of
Johnson, vol. iii. p. 167. The same lofty feelings characterised
his public life, and caused him to be implicitly trusted by the
great party of which, without his own seeking, he was the undisputed
head. Lord Waldegrave seems to have entertained no
mean opinion of his talents.—Memoirs, p. 86. He was Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland in 1737, and afterwards remained for a
time in the Cabinet; but he accepted office with reluctance, and
quitted it with disgust, for he loved his ease and scorned all the
arts of intrigue. He died in 1755, aged fifty-seven.—E.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> Lord Frederick Cavendish had frequently distinguished himself
during the Seven years’ war as an excellent cavalry officer.
In one of the last affairs of the campaign of 1762, he gained great
credit by his spirited behaviour on the 6th of July, when, under
the command of Lord Granby, he defeated a considerable body of
the French stationed at Horn in order to preserve the communication
of the main body with Frankfort, the result of which defeat
was the evacuation of Gottingen. He attained the rank of Field-Marshal,
and died unmarried at an advanced age in 1803.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> The sarcastic tone of these remarks on the Cavendish family
may be ascribed to a family quarrel, in which the Duke of Devonshire
had sided with Horace Walpole the uncle, against Horace
Walpole the nephew, the author of these Memoirs.—Mem. i. 170,
note by Lord Holland. Lord John Cavendish had also displeased
Walpole by often thwarting his plans for the management of the
Opposition, and particularly by prevailing on General Conway to
act contrary to his advice. On these occasions, however, Lord
John was actuated by the purest motives, and no statesman of
that day shewed a nicer sense of honour, or more strict notions of
public duty. His influence with the Liberal party was considerable,
and raised him afterwards to a higher post than his talents
could alone justly claim. At the time to which the text refers he
was about thirty-two years old.—E.</p></div>

Unfortunately they were overshadowed by an infirmity of judgment,
that materially lessened the dignity of his character. He
seems to have been the easy dupe of Archibald Bower. There
was often much misplaced sentiment in his conversation. His
letters teem with foolish conceits, and the extravagant notions he
entertained of parental authority made him so severe and injudicious
a father as to afford some excuse for the gross misconduct of
his son, a young nobleman whose brilliant abilities he was almost
the only person unwilling or unable to appreciate. Lord Lyttelton
died in 1773, at the age of sixty four. His public and private
life had been irreproachable.—E.</p></div>

a censure I regarded so little, that when Lord Holland was
engaged in his bitter persecution of the Whigs under Lord Bute,
I sent an anonymous letter to Wilkes, pointing out a very advantageous
character of Lord Holland that I had formerly written
in the paper called The World, and inciting the North Briton to
take notice both of the author and the subject of the character.
Wilkes caught at the notice, said but little of me, and fell severely
on Lord Holland, as I had foreseen he would.</p></div>

vol. iv. p. 49. Warburton did not carry his imprudence
so far as to print it. He had been a candidate for the see of London
in 1761, and was not a little disappointed by the preference
given to Bishop Hayter, to which he thus <em>modestly</em> alludes in a
letter to Hurd. “You and your poet say true, ‘I will bet at
any time on a fool or a knave against the field.’ Though the
master of the course be changed, yet the field is the same, where
<em>the race is not to the swift</em>.” (Letters from a Late Eminent Prelate,
&amp;c., p. 328.) His hopes must have been rekindled by the early
death of Bishop Hayter, only to be again dashed by the appointment
of Bishop Osbaldiston; and his ambition received a deathblow
by the elevation of Terrick. His contempt of his successful
competitors appears to have been expressed in every way calculated
to be most offensive to them: even at a dinner at Archbishop
Secker’s, about this period, he taunted the Bench with leaving the
defence of the Church against its various assailants to their chaplains,
and not performing the task themselves, as Ridley and Jewel
had done of old; and quoted, at the same time, the saying of Jewel:
“Why are we distinguished from the rest of our brethren with
superior titles and riches, but that we may out-do them in the
service of the public, so that when men see our great achievements,
they may say these men deserve their superior titles and
riches who perform them thus nobly.” The prelates wisely indulged
him in this freedom. He never rose beyond the see of
Gloucester, which it may be remarked he owed not to his learning
and theological reputation, but to Mr. Pitt’s regard for Allen.
Perhaps Mr. Pitt was the only statesman who would have had the
courage to place him on the Bench. Notwithstanding his friendship
with Mr. Yorke, he was neglected by Lord Hardwicke, who,
he says, “amidst all his acquaintance, chose the most barren and
sapless, on which dry plants to shower down his most <em>refreshing
rain</em>.”—Letters, p. 433. The violence of his temper, his overbearing
disposition, and the vagueness of his political creed, gave Ministers
some excuse, yet it shows an imperfection in the system of
ecclesiastical patronage, that a man of his genius and attainments
should have been so often set aside for the obscure and now long
forgotten individuals whom Court or Ministerial favour continually
placed in the higher offices of the Church. He resented this
treatment to the last. It embittered a lot which ought to have
been happy, for he had wealth, rank, reputation, and domestic
prosperity; but his letters breathe an air of discontent unworthy of
a great man. He died at an advanced age in 1776.—E.</p></div>

George Germaine and Primate Stone were his advisers. He died

<p>
In the House of Commons, Mr. Morton seldom spoke except on
questions connected with his profession. The following account of
a singular scene in which he appears as the rash and unequal assailant
of Pitt, has been preserved by Mr. Butler, the great Catholic
counsellor, in his interesting and not uninstructive Reminiscences of
George the Third.
</p>
<p>
On one occasion, Mr. Morton happened to say King, Lords,
and Commons, or (directing his eye towards Mr. Pitt) as that
right honourable Member would call them, Commons, Lords, and
King.—The only fault of this sentence is its nonsense. Mr. Pitt
arose, as he ever did, with great deliberation, and called to order.
“I have,” he said “heard frequently in this House, doctrines which
have surprised me, but now my blood runs cold. I desire the
words of the honourable Member may be taken down.” The Clerks
of the House took down the words. “Bring them to me,” said Mr.
Pitt, with a voice of thunder. By this time Mr. Morton was
frightened out of his senses. “Sir,” he said, addressing himself to
the Speaker, “I am sorry to have given any offence to the right
honourable Member, or to the House. I meant nothing—Kings,
Lords, and Commons,—Lords, Commons, and King,—Commons,
Lords, and King—<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tria juncta in uno</i>. I meant nothing—indeed I
meant nothing.” “I don’t wish to push the matter further,” said
Mr. Pitt, in a voice a little above a whisper, then in a higher
tone, “the moment a man acknowledges his error he ceases to be
guilty. I have a great regard for the honourable Member, and as
an instance of that regard, I give him this advice.” A pause of
some moments ensued; then assuming a look of unspeakable decision,
he said in a kind of colloquial tone, “Whenever that Member
means nothing, I recommend him to say nothing.” (Butler’s
Reminiscences, vol. i. p. 156.) Mr. Morton’s last speech of any
importance was on the Indemnity Bill for sending foreign troops
to Minorca, in 1775. He never rose higher than the Chief
Justiceship of Chester, though he was very near succeeding Mr.
Justice Wilmot, in the King’s Bench; and the memoirs of the
latter contain a very pleasing and well-written letter from him on
the occasion. He had a house at Tackley, near Oxford, in the
church of which place he is buried. He died on the 25th of July,
1780.—E.</p></div>

dulness. Edward Kynaston, of Hardwicke, in the county of Salop,

said that to profit by the latter it was necessary to follow him to
White’s, to drink deep of claret, and remain at table to a very late
hour of the night, or rather of the morning. His dissipated habits,
indeed, were notorious. Junius has alluded to them with bitterness,
and indulged in a profane jest at his expense. (Letter xxiii.)
His straitened circumstances made his nomination very unpopular
in Ireland, and he never went over, (Mr. Croker’s note in Walpole’s
Letters, vol. v. p. 42,) which, however, did not prevent, if we are to

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_147" href="#FNanchor_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> The original MS. states the interview to have been on the
20th of June, obviously by a clerical error, for that date would
make the narrative unintelligible. In a letter to Sir Horace
Mann, of the 26th (Letters, i. p. 237), the day is correctly stated
to be the 12th, which is confirmed by a letter of the Duke of
Bedford to the Duke of Marlborough, of the 13th, giving the details
of the interview.—(Wiffen’s Memoirs of the House of Russell,
p. 70.)—I have ventured to correct the text accordingly.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_148" href="#FNanchor_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> If this narrative be true, Junius is not the libeller that the
world has supposed, and the King was unquestionably treated by
his Ministers in a manner to which a parallel is only to be found
in the reign of Charles the First. George the Third, however, was
not, as Lord Brougham justly observes, (Historical Sketches, &amp;c.,
vol. iii. p. 144,) the monarch to submit to such treatment,—neither
was Sandwich or Halifax likely to have sanctioned it. Indeed
Walpole must be mistaken in making them parties to the transaction.
In a letter written at the time, he intimates that the Duke
of Bedford alone waited upon the King (i. 238); he takes no
notice of any written paper, nor is there any trace of such a
document among the archives at Woburn. The only authentic
account of the interview is given in the letter of the Duke to
his nephew the Duke of Marlborough, cited in the preceding
note, the general tenor of which proves beyond dispute the
writer to have been innocent of any design to insult the King,
as well as ignorant that he had done so. His Grace says that
he reminded the King of the terms on which the Ministers had
consented to resume their functions, and asked whether the
promise made to them on that occasion had been kept. He
complained of the favour shown to the opponents of the Administration,
and the very different treatment received by their friends,
dwelling especially on the influence of Lord Bute; and, finally, he
besought his Majesty “to permit his authority and his favour
to go together, and if the last could not be given to his present
Ministers to transfer to others that authority which must be
useless in their hands unless so strengthened.” Strong words
these, no doubt, and an offensive interpretation may have been
put upon them by a youthful sovereign with the notions of
prerogative inculcated by Lord Bute—a political opponent (like
Burke) might not unfairly insinuate them to be “indecent.” They
furnish also a colourable foundation for the statement in the
text, which is not unlikely to have been derived partially from
the King himself. On the other hand, a dispassionate observer
must take into consideration the general truth of the Duke’s
charges; the feelings of the Ministers at their dismissal on grounds
which appeared to them utterly inadequate; and, above all, their
sense of the public danger resulting from the unsatisfactory relations
of the King with his government. The limits prescribed
by the constitution to a remonstrance of this nature are very
indistinct, and the Duke will be held to have outstepped them
only by the opponent of the political opinions with which the
House of Russell have been so long and so honourably identified.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_149" href="#FNanchor_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> The most plausible explanation of Lord Temple’s conduct on
this occasion is, that he acted on grounds purely personal. It
appears from Lady Hervey’s Letters—an excellent authority—that
as far back as March his connection with Mr. Pitt had in a
great measure ceased. His pride may have been gratified by the
advances made to him by the leading members of the Government,
as unquestionably it was deeply wounded by the proofs he had
lately received of his diminished influence over the Opposition.
The gratification of his vengeance cost him dear, for the Liberal
party never forgave him, and the event showed how entirely his
importance with the country had arisen from his relation to Mr.
Pitt. The engagements into which he immediately after entered
with Mr. Grenville, only served to obstruct his return to power,
and, as will be seen hereafter, to involve him in embarrassments
still more prejudicial to his reputation.—E.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_164" href="#FNanchor_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> Little is now known of Mr. Dowdeswell, beyond the high
estimation in which he was held by the Whig party. His epitaph
is by no means the happiest of Burke’s compositions; but amidst
the cloud of panegyric the rays of truth exhibit a character of
genuine English mould which it is very agreeable to contemplate.
In a private letter, Burke says, “There never was a soul so remote
as his from fraud, duplicity, or fear, so perfectly free from any
of that rapacious unevenness of temper which embitters friendship
and perplexes business. Of all the men I ever knew, he was
the best to act with in public and to live with in private, from
the manly decision and firmness of his judgment, and the extreme
mildness and pleasantness of his temper.” His speeches, imperfectly
as they are reported, prove him to have been a man of plain,
sound, vigorous understanding, and not without respectable powers
of debate. Burke exalts his knowledge of the revenue. He
certainly was one of the leading members of the House, previous
to his appointment, and the distinction conferred upon him was
generally approved, Charles Townshend being forward to claim
the merit of having suggested it. See the interesting Memoirs of
Mr. Dowdeswell, in Cavendish’s Parliamentary Debates, i. 575.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_165" href="#FNanchor_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> The opinion entertained of Lord Rockingham by many of
the most eminent men of his time, is alone sufficient to prove
him not to have been the feeble-minded and insignificant character
described in the text. He had the disadvantage of coming
early into the possession of a princely fortune. His youth was
wasted in the pursuits too common with his rank, and the only
official employment he had as yet filled was that of a Lord
of the Bedchamber. From the time, however, that he applied
himself seriously to politics, he gradually obtained an ascendancy
over his associates such as was possessed by no cotemporary
statesman,—even the opinions of Lord Chatham having less
weight with the more reflecting and intelligent members of the
Liberal party than those of Lord Rockingham. A singular instance
of this ascendancy used to be related by the late Lord Spencer,
who happened to witness it. At a meeting of the Whigs, in 1782,
preparatory to Lord Rockingham’s last Administration, his Lordship
read a list of the appointments which he proposed to submit to the
King. As soon as he uttered the name of Mr. Sheridan as Under-Secretary
of State, the latter, then a young man, justly conscious
of great abilities, and expecting a much higher post, exclaimed, in
an indignant tone, “I will not accept!” Lord Rockingham fixing
his eye on him, calmly but emphatically exclaimed, “You
shall.” Sheridan seemed perfectly daunted, bowed his head, and
made no further remonstrance. It was very rare, said Lord
Spencer, that Lord Rockingham’s decisions did not meet the immediate
acquiescence of the party. Nor was this purchased by the
arts that exhausted the revenues and lowered the character of the
Duke of Newcastle. Lord Rockingham stood clear of any charge
of parliamentary corruption. His mode of living, though noble
as suited his rank, was simple and unostentatious, and the
disinterestedness of his political supporters may be inferred from
the honourable boast of one of the most needy of them, that they
had derived no permanent provision from his acceptance of office.<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a>
The same friendly pen has recorded, in the noble monumental
inscription at Wentworth, “that his virtues were his arts,” and
no doubt he was a virtuous, high-minded, amiable man; but he
owed his success mainly to “a clear, sound, unadulterated sense,”
which showed itself in great discretion, sagacity, and tact. His
views were generally correct, and his firmness and perseverance
never yielded in the most adverse and discouraging crisis, as was
strongly evinced in the great American contest; and thus without
eloquence, or any large share of the qualifications which usually
confer eminence on popular leaders, he retained his political supremacy
to the close of his life.—E.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_172" href="#FNanchor_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> Mr. Pitt’s reply, however, was cold and ungracious, and the

to derive any comfort from it. His repudiation of the charge is
clogged by such a distinct avowal of want of confidence in the
Government, as must have defeated the object for which the

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_174" href="#FNanchor_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> The fact was this: Grenville, afraid of publishing his rapaciousness
before he was sure of success, had forborne to mention
the business to his brethren, the Commissioners of the Treasury,
and even to inquire if the reversion was not already granted;
but, going directly to the King, asked for the reversion. The
King was very loth to bestow it on him; and, on being much
pressed, said, “Mr. Grenville, I thought you were a severe enemy
to all reversions!” Instead of being abashed, he had the confidence
to reply: “Sir, if your Majesty will grant me this, I will take
care you shall never give away another.” The King yielded.
When Grenville notified the boon at the Treasury, he learned, to
his inexpressible mortification, that the reversion was already
engaged. Yet in the year 1770 he had the front, in Parliament,
to censure a lucrative grant for life to Dyson!</p></div>

favour from posterity. A love of truth, a dutiful consideration for
his parents, and a decided preference of active employment, either
civil or military, to the intrigues or frivolities of a Court, honourably
distinguished him from his elder brother. In other respects
he was not much to be esteemed.—E.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_184" href="#FNanchor_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> The concession was made too late to be of much benefit to
the original holders of the bills. It had been confidentially intimated
to the friends of the late Government, before the latter
left office, that the point would not be pressed on the French
Court, and the bills, in consequence, were sold at a very great
depreciation. Sir George Colebrooke, who was one of the sufferers,
mentions the circumstance in his MS. memoirs.—E.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_185" href="#FNanchor_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> When the Duc de Nivernois came to England to conclude the

had paid to that Duke four thousand guineas in specie at a time.
I do not charge the Ministers with the guilt of this corruption.
They were paid by Lord Bute in places, honours, and power;
but that French money had a share in that infamous transaction I
do not doubt. The Duc de Nivernois, a man of economy, spent
above thirty thousand pounds here in half a year. He kept a table
for the tradesmen of London, that they might harangue for the
Peace.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_187" href="#FNanchor_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> His long and able services deserved a less tardy reward.
He had been minister at Berlin from 1753, and was a constant
companion of Frederick the Great during the Seven years’ war.
Few understood that monarch better, and few, it is supposed,
were loved by him so well. He died at an advanced age in 1771.
His correspondence during his embassy, extending to 68 folio volumes,
is preserved in the British Museum, and furnishes many
valuable illustrations of cotemporary history—especially the letters
addressed to him by his correspondents in England. It proves, also,
his sagacity in perceiving that the minister of a representative
Government requires an intimate knowledge of the state of affairs
at home, in order to discharge his duties abroad most to the advantage
of his country.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_190" href="#FNanchor_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> A better reason for dissolving the Parliament was furnished
by the great measures in the contemplation of the new Government.
No doubt the character of the House fell in the public
estimation by the readiness with which the same individuals concurred
in the repeal of Acts passed after due deliberation only in
the preceding year. It is true that circumstances had altered in
the interval, but the only alteration which the country regarded as
influential upon the Parliament, was that which had taken place in
the Government. Some politicians of later date have however
pronounced it a blunder in any Minister to dissolve Parliament
until it has rejected a Government measure.—E.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_191" href="#FNanchor_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> The following are the words of his amendment:—
</p>
<p>
“To express our just resentment and indignation at the outrageous
tumults and insurrections which have been excited and
carried on in North America, and at the resistance given by open
and rebellious force to the execution of the laws in that part of his
Majesty’s dominions.”—E.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_192" href="#FNanchor_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> “He asserted with vehemence his approbation of the Stamp
Act, and was for enforcing it: he leant much to Mr. George
Grenville’s opinion, soothed him, and sat down determined to vote
against his amendment! Mr. Elliot the same; thereby insuring
a double protection.”—Mr. Cooke to Mr. Pitt. Chatham Correspondence,
vol. ii. p. 351.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_193" href="#FNanchor_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> Lord Shelburne appears to have spoken rather against the
amendment than for the Ministers. He regarded the language
applied to the Americans by the Opposition both in their speeches
and the amendment as dangerous, and perhaps imprudent and
unjust, and he deprecated a motion which seemed to preclude a
repeal before it was considered thoroughly how far it might be
necessary. His speech met with Mr. Pitt’s entire approbation.—(Lord
Shelburne’s Letter to Mr. Pitt, and the reply in the Chatham
Correspondence, vol. ii. p. 353.)—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_195" href="#FNanchor_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> He was affectionate to his daughters, but surely not to the

employment, and whose death he bore with feelings of very slight
regret.—E.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_196" href="#FNanchor_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> He even stood at a window to see her coffin carried out of the

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_197" href="#FNanchor_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> If the French were thus ignorant of the real character of the
Dauphin, the ignorance has been of long continuance. All the
French historians regard him as a fanatic. According to Sismondi
(Histoire des Français, vol. xxix. p. 328) the Archbishop of Paris
and the Molinist clergy formed around him a cabal which at first
inspired alarm, next disdain, and at last pity. The story of his
scepticism came, probably, to Walpole from the Duc de Choiseul,
who had always been on the worst terms with him; nor is the
Duc de Nivernois, the partizan of Choiseul, a courtier of pursuits
and feelings utterly dissimilar to those of the prince, a much better
authority. The only vice which the irreproachable conduct of the
Dauphin admitted of being imputed to him, was hypocrisy. Whether
he had sufficient energy of character to have averted the
destruction which afterwards overwhelmed his unfortunate son,
is more doubtful. He was personally brave, and is said to have
shown spirit and readiness at Fontenoy, and it was with difficulty
that the jealousy of the Duc de Choiseul could prevent his
serving in the seven years’ war; but the qualities requisite for
the successor of Louis the Fifteenth, were hardly compatible
with his gentle, yielding, and amiable disposition. He died on
the 20th of December, 1765, in his thirty-seventh year.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_198" href="#FNanchor_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> The Dauphin certainly preserved a tender attachment for the
memory of his first wife, the Infanta Maria Therese. She died
in child-bed in July, 1746. This did not, however, prevent his
appreciating the merit of the second Dauphiness. Observing him
in tears just before their marriage, she bade him indulge his grief,
for it assured her of what she too might expect from his regard if
she had the happiness to deserve it. She was by no means
popular in the coteries frequented by Walpole, but by the nation
at large she was held in high estimation. Her death was ascribed
to a disorder she had contracted in nursing her husband. The
Duchesse de Lauragais might have treated the expressions of a
person in the agonies of death with more indulgence. Judging
from this speech, she must have been as heartless as her lover
the Maréchal de Richelieu, than whom, allowing for the difference
of sex, she was not much more respectable.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_199" href="#FNanchor_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> The Duchesse was a niece of the financier Croisat, and brought
to the Duc the great fortune of four millions of livres. After her
husband’s death she retired into a convent, and submitted to
severe privations in order to obtain the means of paying not only
his debts, but even his legacies, for he had the assurance to make
large testamentary bequests, though he must have known himself
to be worse than insolvent. She was the Duc’s second wife.
His first, also a considerable heiress, died within a year of their
marriage, and he generously restored her fortune to her relations,
though he was at that time poor.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_200" href="#FNanchor_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> His mal-administration of Brittany was an appropriate prelude
to his career as President of the Council. In both offices he incurred
almost universal hatred and contempt. It was at the
Court alone that he shone. There his brilliant success was undeniable;
and indeed it is not to be wondered at, for he was eminently
adroit and specious; and, with a noble deportment, he possessed
the art of expressing himself nobly. The English officers taken at
St. Cas returned home fascinated by his urbanity and generous
sayings. Though an undisguised profligate, he was the acknowledged
leader of the religious party to which the Dauphin belonged,
and the confidant of that exemplary Prince; and this did not
prevent his subsequently becoming the minister of Louis the
Fifteenth. The Duc was the great-nephew of Cardinal de Richelieu,
and had inherited Aiguillon from the Cardinal’s favourite
niece, Madame de Combalet. He died in 1783, leaving an only
son.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_201" href="#FNanchor_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> The persecution to which M. de Chalotais was subjected
has been detailed in a work extending to three volumes quarto,
entitled “Procès Extraordinaire contre MM. Caradeuc de la
Chalotais,” &amp;c., with this singular motto: “Ad perpetuam
sceleris memoriam.” He appears to have narrowly escaped with
his life. The most important witness against him was a young
Maître de Requêtes, M. de Calonne, twenty years later unhappily
celebrated as the minister of Louis the Sixteenth. The
trial gives a frightful picture of the state of criminal justice in
France in those days. M. de Chalotais had pure motives,
and was an able man; but his indiscretion, the irascibility of his
temper, and the bitterness with which he treated all who differed
from him in opinion, no doubt greatly aggravated his difficulties.
His first work, “Compte rendu des Constitutions des Jesuites,”
appeared in 1762, he being then sixty-one years of age: from
that time until his death, in 1785, he maintained a hot and
incessant warfare against the Court and religious parties, who
regarded him as the representative of principles fraught with
ruin to them both. This struggle no doubt materially hastened
the Revolution. An interesting account of the proceedings against
Chalotais is given in Anquetil (Hist. de France, vol. viii. p. 106–116),

where, in conjunction with the Infant Don Philip, he commanded
the allied army of France and Spain. He possessed the personal
courage, the cleverness, the turn for political intrigue, and the
wrong-headedness which seemed hereditary in his family. The
part he took in the affairs of the Parliament gained him the
sobriquet, from the King, of “Mon Cousin l’Avocat.” He

for his country he was trusted with high commands, even
after the battle of Rosbach, where he had shared all the dishonour
of that signal defeat. The assistance of Marshal d’Estrèes enabled
him for once to be successful at Johannisburgh. He died in 1787,
aged seventy-two. The ex-Jesuit, Georgel, who was attached to
the family, has painted him in flattering colours. See Mémoires

probably exhausted by long service. He had greatly distinguished
himself at Fontenoy; but his chief exploit was the victory he gained
at Hastenbeck, over the Duke of Cumberland. This did not
prevent his being harshly treated by the Court, and through the
intrigues of the Maréchal de Richelieu he was for a time deprived
of his rank and employment, and imprisoned in the Castle of
Doulens on an unfounded charge of having left his victory incomplete.
He was afterwards recalled and employed, but his
last campaign against Prince Ferdinand was not a successful one.

were cold and reserved, which his enemies ascribed to pride,
and his friends to modesty. He never was popular. As Minister
of Marine he appears to have discharged his duties efficiently,
and the French fleet under his administration recovered the losses
it had suffered in the war. His splendid seat near Melun, still
in the possession of his descendants, and formerly the delight of
the Intendant Fouquet, shows that his public services were not
unrewarded. He died in 1795, aged seventy-three.—E.</p></div>

l’extérieur réfléchi d’un homme d’état, et il en avoit la réputation

and he was among its early victims. The manner of his
death is uncertain; the Abbé Morellet, his friend and dependant,
insinuating that he poisoned himself. According to an article in
the Biographie Universelle, which is very carefully written, he
died in consequence of the brutal treatment he received from some
soldiers at Sens. The Abbé makes a feeble effort to defend his
memory.—(Mémoires de Morellet, vol. i. p. 17; vol. ii. p. 16–467.)—E.</p></div>

on Maurepas before the latter was restored to office. Agreeable
as he might be in society, he proved a most inefficient
minister, and altogether unequal to the times. He died in 1781,
eighty years old, regretted only by the King and the courtiers,
who enjoyed his wit and profited by his patronage. One of his

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_249" href="#FNanchor_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> Some political writers, opposed to the Rockingham Ministry,
have condemned and ridiculed this bill as inconsistent with the
principle, and calculated to defeat the object of the repeal of the
Stamp Act. Indeed, they have gone so far as to say that it raised
an insurmountable barrier to the settlement of these unhappy differences.
However unjust the charge may be, the bill proved a
fertile experiment to maintain the dignity of the country, and the
best defence of the measure is to be found in the state of political
parties, which rendered it apparently impossible to obtain the
repeal without this concession to the feelings of the King, and to
public opinion. The Colonies, also, gave themselves, at that time,
little concern about abstract resolutions of right, so long as the
same were not carried into practice. The joy with which the
Repeal Act was received in America seems to have been unqualified,
and some years elapsed before any serious objections were
taken against the Declaratory Act. Even in 1775, Burke writing
to his Committee at Bristol, observes, that it had not yet become a
grievance with the Colonists.—E.</p></div>

learn from the same writer that the bad state of Lord Northington’s
health, and his frequent disagreements with his colleagues,
had for some months made him desirous of an honourable and
quiet retreat. There is no doubt, both from his own letters, and
the traditions still extant at the bar, that his habits of hard labour
and extreme conviviality had by this time undermined his constitution
much to the deterioration of his temper, and he perhaps
suspected slights that were never intended. Moreover, the scrupulous
sense of public duty, the natural reserve and strict propriety
of deportment which characterized Lord Rockingham and Mr.
Conway were by no means to his taste. He must have felt even
less easy with such associates, than his successor Lord Thurlow did
in a later day with Mr. Pitt; and, like him, his usual course in the
Cabinet was to originate nothing, and to oppose everything. The
commercial treaty with Russia, a measure of unquestionable benefit,
nearly fell to the ground, owing to his unreasonable and obstinate
opposition. He would rarely listen to remonstrances from his
colleagues, and was on such cold terms with them as probably
justified him in his own mind in breaking up the Cabinet so
unceremoniously. He was too fearless to stoop to intrigue, and
there was no necessity for it on this occasion. His communications

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_265" href="#FNanchor_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> That Mr. Pitt’s indisposition was no pretence, is proved by his
letters to Lady Chatham. He says on the 15th of July, evidently
to calm her anxiety,—“In a word, three hot nights in town rendered
a retreat hither [Hampstead] necessary, where I brought yesterday
a feverish heat and much bile, and have almost lost it already.”
Throughout their correspondence his health is a constant topic, and
the extreme delicacy of his nervous system certainly rendered his
acceptance of office a most imprudent act.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_266" href="#FNanchor_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> In a letter of explanation to Lady Chatham, written a fortnight
after his interview with Mr. Pitt at Hampstead, Lord
Temple admits that his separation from Mr. George Grenville was
conditional upon “a public and general union of parties taking
place.” This union had long been one of the great objects of
Mr. Pitt’s ambition, but was at this time wholly impracticable, as
Lord Temple well knew; and taken together with the proposal of
Lord Lyttelton for President of the Council, the admission goes far
to support Walpole’s statement, that Lord Temple had determined
not to take office without his brother. Indeed the connections
which Lord Temple had lately formed, and not less than the
opinions he had expressed in Parliament, must have rendered his
acceptance of Mr. Pitt’s overtures out of the question, unless, to
use his own words, he had chosen “to be stuck into the Ministry
as a great cypher at the head of the Treasury.”—(Chatham
Correspondence, vol. ii. p. 468.)—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_267" href="#FNanchor_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> Nevertheless, had their former connection remained unbroken,
Lord Temple might have again proved a valuable colleague to
Mr. Pitt. The restless spirit and defective temper, that hurried
him when in opposition into excesses so prejudicial to his character,
had not prevented his identifying himself completely with Mr. Pitt
while in office in all great questions of public policy, and though he
had no claim to superior merit as a speaker, his knowledge of the
world, fixedness of purpose, and close attention to the details of
business, had often compensated for the absence of those qualities
in Mr. Pitt. Above all, he was really loved and trusted by him, and
through Lady Chatham’s intervention, had access to him when
it was denied to every one else. Neither of them prospered after
their separation, and Lord Temple had the mortification of finding
himself alternately neglected, distrusted, and opposed by the
associates of his earlier days during the remainder of his life.—E.</p></div>

by Lord Temple in those negotiations was soon afterwards published,
under the title of “An Inquiry into the Conduct of a late
Right Honourable Commoner.” It is justly described by Lord
Chesterfield as “scurrilous and scandalous, and betraying private
conversation.” It is believed to have been written by Mr. Humphry
Cotes, but Lord Temple was suspected to have furnished
the materials; and it probably is to this discreditable piece of revenge,
more than to the other libels in which Lord Temple was
concerned, that Lord Rockingham alluded when he noticed some
years afterwards the objection of the Whigs to act under his Lordship.—E.</p></div>

few more were friends of the Duke of Grafton. Yet with these
losses, Lord Rockingham’s party remained a very respectable body

of their chief, the obstinacy of Lord John Cavendish, the want
of judgment in Burke, their own too great delicacy, and the abandoned
venality of the age, reduced them to be of no consequence,
as will appear: but the Duke of Newcastle’s impotent lust of power,
Lord Holland’s daring and well-timed profligacy, Lord Chatham’s
haughty folly, and Lord Temple’s unprincipled and selfish thirst
of greatness, had baffled all opposition, had counterworked Lord

end. [This disability, which the decision of the House of Lords

The Corporation obtained a judgment against him in the Lord
Mayor’s Court, which they expected to be as effectual in his case
as it had proved with other contumacious Dissenters; but he appealed
to the higher City Courts, and having failed there, carried
his plea before the Judge Delegates, who, after a deliberate hearing,
decided in his favour. The Corporation then, in turn, appealed to
the House of Lords, and the Judges being consulted, Mr. Baron
Perrot, the Judge who had distinguished himself by his panegyric
on Lord Bute, was the only authority on the Bench that supported
the views of the Corporation. The House of Lords accordingly

who bragged of it long afterwards, stood thus. He and Wedderburne
went to Grenville at Wootton, before the Parliament met, and
proposed to him to try to take off two shillings in the pound. Grenville,
who not only knew the impossibility of sparing so much, and
the mischief the country would suffer, but flattered himself he
should soon be Minister again, vehemently opposed the plan;
however, as they persisted, he compromised the matter, by making
them promise they would confine the reduction to one shilling, for
which he not only voted but spoke ably, though so much against
his opinion. Perhaps he would have done less hurt, if he had
joined in the attempt to reduce it two shillings in the pound, which
would have appeared so capital a mischief, that it might possibly
have miscarried; and, indeed, supposing a possibility of so much
conscientiousness in that or the next Parliament, is paying a compliment
to them that may be thought to be overstrained.</p></div>

veiled them for better use; Lord Gower had neither feeling, shame,

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_341" href="#FNanchor_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> Walpole’s hatred of the Duke and Duchess of Bedford must
have been intense, or his sagacity could have scarcely overlooked,
that in censuring Junius he condemns himself. Perhaps he is the
more blameable of the two. Junius may have believed the Duke
to have been a bad man. Walpole has elsewhere described him
as having a good heart. He knew the facts urged by Junius in
support of the charge of the Duke being an unnatural parent to
be untrue; and yet he not only leaves them uncontradicted, but
frames his narration so as to facilitate their belief. The Duke’s
memory has been repeatedly vindicated from this cruel aspersion,
and never with more generous and indignant eloquence than lately
by Lord Brougham.—(Political Sketches, vol. iii.) It has always
been understood in the quarters likely to be the best informed,
that he felt his son’s loss deeply to the last hour of his life. Instead,
however, of yielding to his grief, he endeavoured to employ his
thoughts on public business, and the natural fervour of his disposition
insensibly engaged him in the scenes before him perhaps more
deeply than he was aware of. The meeting he attended at the
India House must, as appears from the Company’s books, have
been that of the 8th of April, which determined the course to be
taken by the Company on the Government propositions: a great
question, in which he took the liveliest interest. The force of
mind he thus displayed is noticed with commendation in a letter
written at the time by David Hume, who, from his connection with
Conway, is assuredly an impartial witness.—(Hume to M. de Barbantine,
Cav. Debates, vol. i. p. 601.) The absurd charge brought
by Junius against the Duchess, of making money by Lord Tavistock’s
wardrobe, originated in its having been sold for the benefit
of his valet and Lady Tavistock’s maid, according to the general
practice of that day.—E.</p></div>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
